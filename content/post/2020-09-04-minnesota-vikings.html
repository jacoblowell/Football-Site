<p>The NFC North is an interesting division. The division winner Packers made the NFC
Championship game and decided instead of adding a missing link to get over the hill, to
draft for the future by taking a quarterback in the first round. The second-place Vikings,
who also made the playoffs and upset the Saints while there, decided to overhaul the roster.</p>
<p>Picture Mike Zimmer’s defense. The 4-3 features four down linemen. If the offense is .playing with three wide receivers, Zimmer has his slot corner on the field. You have
seven defenders close to the line of scrimmage: four linemen and three corners. Of those
seven starters in 2019, only two remain on the roster in 2020.</p>
<p>Gone are Linval Joseph (Chargers) and Everson Griffen (TBD) from the line and all .</p>
<p>three starting corners: Xavier Rhodes (Colts), Trae Waynes (Bengals), and Mackensie .</p>
<p>Alexander (Bengals). That is a significant upheaval for the seventh-ranked defense of .
2019.
Offensively, the Vikings lost two of their most important pieces: offensive coordinator
Kevin Stefanski and wide receiver Stefon Diggs. Almost hilariously, Stefon Diggs earned
.3.9 EPA when RUSHING the ball last year. The entire 2019 season, Dalvin Cook only earned 6.9 EPA, and all other rushers were between 2.0 EPA (Mike Boone) and -10.2 .
EPA (Alexander Mattison). As a receiver, Diggs’s EPA was 38.4, outpacing all other Vikings receivers by a significant margin (No. 2 was down at 21.4 EPA).
And of course, then there is Stefanski. To understand Stefanski, we must first back up a year to 2018, when the Vikings lost Pat Shurmur to a head job with the Giants and hired former Eagles quarterbacks coach John DeFilippo. I wrote extensively about DeFilippo vs Shurmur in last year’s chapter, but the Cliff Notes versions was:</p>
<p>The Vikings started the season 4-2-1 (67%) through Week 7 using a pass-heavy first down philosophy under DeFilippo, passing the ball on 63% of first half first downs. It was second-most in the NFL and was well above the 52% NFL average. These passes produced a 64% success rate (third in the NFL) and 8.1 YPA (10th). Meanwhile, first half first down rushes earned just a 39% success rate (28th) and 3.5 YPC (28th). Passes gained 0.30 EPA/att while rushes gained a terrible -0.12 EPA/att.
And yet, Zimmer wanted to run more. So from Week 8 until when DeFilippo was fired (Week 14) the Vikings reduced their pass rate from 63% on those plays down to 54%. The team went 2-4 during this stretch, and the in-house arguments between the pass-heavy DeFilippo and the run-centric Zimmer eventually resulted in the OC’s firing.
Stefanski stuck to the script from the jump, seeing first hand what happens when you don’t. The Vikings passed the ball on just 41% of the first half first downs when he called plays, considerably less than the NFL average and insanely lower than DeFilippo’s rate. The Vikings beat the terrible 6-10 Lions, the 7-9 Dolphins, and were throttled by the Trubisky-led 12-4 Bears, but Stefanski was able to retain his offensive coordinator title as the team entered the 2019 season.
It’s always interesting to try and get inside the mind of defensive coordinators that are head coaches. Of 32 NFL head coaches, only 11 of 32 (34.4%) were former NFL defensive coaches and they include Dan Quinn, Sean McDermott, Vic Fangio, Matt Patricia, Brian Flores, Mike Zimmer, Bill Belichick, Mike Tomlin, Pete Carroll, Mike Vrabel, and Ron Rivera. Several of these coaches allow the offense to operate autonomously, as its own unit. Coaches that have put the kibosh on heavy, aggressive passing games of recent have included Matt Patricia, Pete Carroll, and Mike Zimmer.
If a team is going to go with a defensive-minded head coach, I prefer him to hire a creative, aggressive offensive coordinator and allow him free reign, understanding that offense wins games and his own job is to ensure the team wins as many games as possible. Defensive coaches that interfere offensively, trying to instill a more conservative, less creative approach almost always restrict the ceiling of the offense.
The best example of a defensive-minded head coach who understands the true job and responsibility of a head coach is to win as many games as possible has been Bill Belichick. Belichick has allowed Josh McDaniels to create and stay aggressive offensively, and at times, Belichick himself is involved in that creative process with the goal to keep the offensive as creative and unpredictable as possible.
And that last word is most key: “unpredictable.” Conservative offense almost always goes hand-in-hand with predictability. With the rules of today’s game, offenses run the show. More often than not, good offense will always beat good defense. Talent being equal, it won’t be close, thanks to the rules. The only thing offenses can do that gives a defense the upper hand is to become predictable. And that is what these defensive-minded head coaches don’t realize enough. By influencing the offense, they are interjecting a conservativeness that inserts predictability.</p>
<p>Look at it from the other run-heavy, conservative speak for themselves:
side of the ball. Would Mike Zimmer himself rather face a offense? Or a pass-heavy, aggressive offense? The results
Over the last four years, the Vikings are 11-15 (42%) against teams ranking top-15 in pass rate and pass efficiency. They are 29-10 (74%) against all other teams.
Yet Zimmer himself all too often is the puppeteer, controlling the strings of the offense, and restricting creative, open minded, and aggressive offense.
At times with these defensive-minded coaches, the question comes back to, what is the ceiling? Belichick can go all the way and did so by letting the offense stay efficient. Tomlin lets the Steelers pass as often as the offensive coordinator wants. Both won multiple Super Bowls. Quinn showed similar with Kyle Shanahan taking them to a Super Bowl but coming up just short.</p>
<p>Rivera allowed his OCs to run their room and likewise advanced to a Super Bowl but fell short.
We don’t yet know about Flores, Vrabel, McDermott, or Fangio as to how much they’ll influence the offensive strategy and whether it will limit their team’s ceiling.
But at the other end of the spectrum, we have seen the Lions turned decidedly run-heavy when Patricia took over. Carroll was able to win with Russell Wilson on his rookie deal, but despite all of Wilson’s brilliance, he hasn’t made up for the conservative offensive structure since. And then there is Zimmer, who falls into this same bucket where he appears to influence the offense too often.
When you have a defensive-minded head coach, a lot of scrutinies should (justifiably) come on his defense. And where does that leave Zimmer with regard to his defense?
In 2019, the Vikings played:</p>
<p>2 games vs rookie QBs (David Blough, Daniel Jones)
3 games vs bad veteran QBs (Matt Moore, Case Keenum, Derek Carr) • 5 games v the Bears &amp; Packers &amp; the Broncos’ Brandon Allen
6 games vs respectable QBs
Here is what those six QBs produced:
Dak Prescott: 397 yds, 9.0 YPA, 59% success Matthew Stafford: 364 yds, 8.1 YPA, 56% success Philip Rivers: 307 yds, 8.1 YPA, 58% success Carson Wentz: 306 yds, 7.7 YPA, 55% success Matt Ryan: 304 yds, 6.8 YPA, 53% success Russell Wilson: 240 yds, 7.7 YPA, 52% success
And those three games vs the bad vets? Moore had 8.1 YPA and a 62% success rate, Keenum also had 8.1 YPA with a 75% success rate, and Carr was at 7.3 YPA with a 61% success rate and a 105 rating.
The Vikings still beat Prescott, Stafford, Rivers, Wentz, and Ryan but lost to Wilson.
But do we really credit the Vikings defense for beating the Cowboys, when Prescott was converting everything, Ezekiel Elliott was averaging 2.4 YPC, the Cowboys were on the Vikings 11-yard line, down four points with 1:30 left in the game, and chose to run Zeke on 2nd &amp; 2 (0 yard gain) and 3rd &amp; 2 (loss of 3) instead of letting Dak carve?
Do we credit the Vikings defense for beating the terrible Brandon Allen, when the Broncos were up 20 points at halftime, and teams were 0-99 the last five years when trailing by 20+ at halftime? Previously, only 28 of 1,399 teams in NFL history overcame such a halftime deficit. It was the Vikings offense that earned that win.
The Vikings had three things going for them: turnover luck, injury luck, and field goal luck.
First, the primary determining factor as to whether the Vikings would win a game last season wasn’t EDSR, it was turnovers. They went 8-2 when winning the turnover battle and 1-4 when losing it. It was similar to 2018, when they were 4-0 when winning the turnover battle and 2-4-1 when losing it. Or 2017, when they were 9-0 when winning the turnover battle and 2-4 when losing it. Or 2016, when they were 7-2 when winning the turnover battle and 1-3 when losing it.</p>
<p>The difference between 2019 and 2018 is the 2019 Vikings were +11 in turnovers on the season while the 2018 Vikings were a net zero (and finished 8-8).
But the Vikings finished second in fumble recovery luck and recovered 5.3 more fumbles than expected based on average recovery rates. This aided their +11 net turnover margin and helped them win the turnover battle in 10 of 16 games, winning 8 of those 10.
Second, injury luck. The Vikings have been fortunate with player health. They were the healthiest team in the NFL last year. Their health over the last six years: first, 12th, 11th, 30th, 12th, and eighth. They’ve been running hot with injury luck for a number of years, and at some point, that pendulum may swing back to league-average.
Third, field goal luck. In 2018, the Vikings had a net field goal make rate (comparing own vs opponent’s against them) of -23%, which ranked dead last in the NFL. But in 2019, their net field goal make rate was 7%, which was eighth-best. But that 30% swing from 2018 to 2019 was by far the largest year over year swing in the NFL from 2018 to 2019.
If turnover luck, injury luck, or field goal luck regress, the 2020 Vikings won’t be happy with their end-of-season results.
Looking at what may change from 2019, the Vikings will be using former assistant head coach Gary Kubiak as offensive coordinator now that Stefanski received a head coaching assignment in Cleveland.
The 2019 Vikings used 3+ wide receivers on only 22.9% of snaps, by FAR the least often in the NFL. The NFL average was almost triple that rate (64.6%). Instead, they used a ton of 2-TE &amp; 2-RB sets.
While I think that Stefanski will take that with him to Cleveland to assist Baker Mayfield, there are a number of interesting observations that may bleed over from 2019’s Vikings offense into 2020.
If Kubiak runs a lot of 12 personnel like last year, it’s probably a good thing. But Kirk Cousins’s struggles in 11 personnel were notable. Typically when a quarterback is pressured, his results drop precipitously compared to when he’s kept clean. And while he was better without pressure from most groupings, Cousins’s efficiency was terrible even when clean in 11 personnel: 44% success, 7.7 YPA, 0.11 EPA/att, and 79.6 rating.</p>
<p>The Vikings wielded an efficient passing game in 2020, ranking seventh in the league in success rate (49%), eighth in yards per pass attempt (8.0 Y/A), and ninth in EPA via their passing game. Quarterback Kirk Cousins set full-season high marks in touchdown rate (5.9%) and yards per attempt (8.1 Y/A). Using play-action, Cousins was sensational, completing 71.8% of his passes for 9.7 Y/A and matching Lamar Jackson for the league lead with 14 passing touchdowns off the use of play-action. 53/9% of his passing touchdowns came via play-action, the highest rate in the league. The only rub was that despite all of that efficiency, the Vikings ran just 494 passing plays, which was 31st in the league while ranking 29th in the league in passing rate (52%). Controlling for game script, Minnesota led for 47% of their offensive snaps on the season, which was seventh in the league.</p>
<p>Attached to a highly efficient passer, Minnesota wide receivers ranked first in the league in yards per pass attempt to wide receivers (10.1 yards) and seventh in success rate (55%). They threw just 47% of the time to their wideouts, however, which ranked 29th in the league. With Adam Thielen playing just 43% of the snaps, Stefon Diggs was electric. Diggs was second in the NFL in receiving yards per team pass attempt (2.42 yards) in 2019 and accounted for 30.3% of the Minnesota passing yardage, which was sixth among all wideouts. He has now been traded this offseason, putting the crux of the receiving work into the hands of Thielen while first-round wideout Justin Jefferson gets acclimated to the NFL.</p>
<p>The Vikings were fourth in the league in run rate (48%) and ran the ball the fourth-most times (476) in 2019. With all that volume, however, Minnesota ranked 15th in success rate (47%), 20th in yards above success rate, and 27th in yards to successful play while checking in 16th in EPA on the ground. Third-year back Dalvin Cook broke out, rushing for 1,135 yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground. Cook and the organization could be headed for a standoff this offseason over a desired contract extension by Cook while backups Alexander Mattison (4.6 YPC and 38% success rate) and Mike Boone (5.6 YPC and 42% success rate) had spouts of efficiency on limited opportunities behind Cook (4.5 YPC and 46% success rate) in 2019.</p>
<p>Bet on More Passing from the Vikings in 2020
Although the Vikings are sure to retain a run-centric philosophy on offense, circumstances make them a strong objective bet to actually pass more in 2020. Minnesota was just the 14th team since 2011 to run fewer than 500 passing plays in a season. Of the 12 other teams (the 2019 Ravens are here as well) to have this few passing plays, 10 of the 12 ran more passing plays the following season. The average increase among those 12 teams was 65.3 passing plays the following season with an average of 542.6 passing plays run per season by those teams.
Minnesota led for 47% of their offensive snaps on the season, which was seventh in the league and played into their offensive approach a year ago. Of those 12 teams, nine saw the percentage of plays in which they were ahead on the scoreboard decrease the following season with an average loss of an 11.0% rate of those offensive snaps. That all culminated in an average passing rate increase among those teams of 4.8%.
Even if we bump up the arbitrary passing play total to teams that ran fewer than 550 passing plays over that stretch, 86.4% (51-of-59) had a spike in passing plays the following season with an average increase of 56.3 passing plays the following season. We know the Vikings want to run the football and are unlikely to be among the league leaders in dropbacks in 2020, but they are a solid bet to not have the same game script from a year ago and will throw more this upcoming season regardless of mindset.
Buy an Adam Thielen Rebound in 2020
With that in the corner of our minds and the trade of Stefon Diggs this offseason, Adam Thielen should be on your radar as an undervalued asset over the summer. Dealing with a hamstring injury suffered just nine snaps into Week 7, Thielen played just 43% of the team snaps in 2020. Prior to that injury, Thielen was the WR12 in overall PPR scoring, catching 27-of-40 targets for 391 yards and six touchdowns while averaging 14.5 yards per catch. Among all players with at least 25 targets in 2019, Thielen had a reception of 20 or more yards or a touchdown on 29.2% of his targets, which was fourth in the league. Over the opening six weeks fully healthy, Thielen accounted for 25% of the team’s targets compared to 22% for Diggs, while Diggs bested Thielen in percentage of team air yards (45% to 36%). Thielen had seven of the 12 team end zone targets over that span.
With the selection of Justin Jefferson in the first round, Thielen will not have to return to a slot-centric role and should take on a portion of the vertical targets that Diggs was receiving while Thielen still remains a viable touchdown threat with 17 end zone targets over the past two seasons. We have seen Thielen have a stretch where he was bonafide WR1 in fantasy football before and you can draft him outside of that range in 2020.</p>
<p>Minnesota saw a mass exodus on the defensive side of the ball, but they hit the draft to get cheaper and probably not much worse options.
The Vikings moved on from Linval Joseph but replaced him with Michael Pierce — a rare place where they actually replaced a departing player on defense in free agency. While this could still be an above-average run defense interior line, there is little to no potential pass rush here. That’s a problem. James Lynch had a high pressure rate from the interior at Baylor but it’s unknown if his play strength will translate to the NFL.
Everson Griffen is gone and does not appear to be returning as a free agent. That leaves Danielle Hunter, who is still dominant, and some questions on the edge for the Vikings. Ifedi Odeninigbo had seven sacks as a rotational player but ranked 43rd of 81 edge rushers with at least 250 pass rushes in pressure rate per SIS. He’s penciled in as a starter and that pressure will have to increase while his sack rate is likely to regress. Both Eddie Yarbrough and Anothony Zettel both flashed in 2017 but haven’t seen the field much since. Fourth-round pick D.J. Wonnum will likely work his way into the rotation.
Eric Kendricks was one of the best coverage linebackers in the league last season and he made up for a step back from Anthony Barr. This is one of the stronger units, especially for the Vikings who didn’t lose anyone of note from the group this offseason. Oregon’s Troy Dye was added in the fourth round and he adds solid depth with coverage and athleticism.
At corner, Xavier Rhodes, Trae Waynes, and Mackensie Alexander are all gone. That wasn’t a great trio in 2019 (Alexander was the only one who performed above expectations) but the loss of all of those players takes away any semblance of depth at the position. Mike Hughes is now left as the No. 1. Jeff Gladney will be the other outside starter after he was taken in the first round. Minnesota also grabbed Cameron Dantzler (Mississippi State) in the third round and the highly athletic Harrison Hand (Temple) in the fifth.
The good news at safety is Anthony Harris and Harrison Smith are quite good. The bad news is there are only late-round rookies behind them. Josh Metellus (sixth round) and Brian Cole (seventh) serve as the only depth at the position.</p>
<p>From every other grouping he used on at least 15 clean dropbacks, he averaged at least 60% success, at least 8.1 YPA, at least 0.33 EPA/att, and at least a 113 rating. Making matters worse, the only receiver to average positive EPA and at least 50% success on targets from 11 personnel was Stefon Diggs, and now Diggs is gone:
Diggs: 0.76 EPA/att, 61% success, 13.3 YPA Thielen: -0.15 EPA/att, 44% success, 6.4 YPA Rudolph: -0.22 EPA/att, 20% success, 6.2 YPA Treadwell: -0.13 EPA/att, 33% success, 6.5 YPA Johnson: 0.49 EPA/att, 43% success, 8.0 YPA Cook: 0.26 EPA/att, 37% success, 6.3 YPA
Without Diggs, it will be interesting to see how Kubiak installs efficiency to 11 personnel. Due to Adam Theilen’s multi-week injury, only two Vikings were targeted 50+ times: Diggs and Cook. The Vikings, without DeFilippo, shifted from 62% pass in one-score games down to 55% pass, the third-largest shift toward the run of the NFL. Cousins spent a ton of time under center and a ton of time handing the ball off to Dalvin Cook.
The problem for the Vikings in 2019 was the lack of efficiency of these runs. In order to prevent hurting Cook by including fourth quarter carries that run out the clock, let’s look at first quarter carries, knowing the 2018 Vikings passed the ball often on these first downs. Cook primarily ran out of 12 personnel or 21 personnel in the first quarter. His combined runs from all other groupings total 27 attempts, the same number he had from 12 personnel. The efficiency of such runs wasn’t anything beneficial for the Vikings:
12 personnel: 37% success, 2.6 YPC, -0.26 EPA/att 21 personnel: 38% success, 3.2 YPC, -0.08 EPA/att
One final nugget with regard to 2019 play calling which may or may not bleed into 2020 with Kubiak: pre-snap motion. Overall, the Vikings saw improvement from play-action, like most teams in the league. On early downs the first three quarters of games, the league average is to see 1.9 more YPA, 4% more success, and 0.14 more EPA per play-action pass as compared to non-play-action passes. But the Vikings gained only 1.0 more YPA, lost 2% success, and gained 0.14 more EPA per play-action pass. Thus, at or worse than league average improvement by using play-action, they used it at well above average rates.
However, they used pre-snap motion at below average rates, yet saw much more improvement when passing with pre-snap motion. Look at the comparison vs the league average with the advantage gained by using pre-snap motion prior to passes.
NFL avg: 0.2 more YPA, 3% more success, 0.02 more EPA/att Vikings: 1.6 more YPA, 6% more success, 0.25 more EPA/att
The Vikings used the 20th-most pre-snap motion ahead of passes but had the NFL’s best improvement. Meanwhile, they used the sixth-most play-action but only had the 25th most improvement with play-action. Perhaps the Vikings weren’t aware of the massive edge they were getting from pre-snap motion, but it was great yet underused.
This next nugget is pretty insane. Since Mike Zimmer came to Minnesota, the Vikings are 1-17-1 (5.6%) outdoors against a team with a winning record. They are 3-15-1 ATS (16.7%). Those straight up and against the spread wins were all back in 2015. That was five years ago. Since 2016, Zimmer’s team is 0-15-1 (0%) both SU and ATS. That is remarkable. And most of these games aren’t close. They’ve been an average underdog of only +2.6 points and lose on average by 10.5 ppg.
The incredible thing is, I shared this nugget in last year’s book, when the trend was 0-10-1 SU and ATS. Zimmer’s team played five more games last year outdoors against teams with a winning record. I literally predicted which teams the Vikings would face outdoors with a winning record in my book last year at this time: Packers (correct), Bears (correct), Chiefs (correct), Seahawks (correct), and Chargers (incorrect). The Vikings went 0-4 SU and ATS against these teams, and then they added a ridiculous 27-10 loss to the 49ers in the playoffs for good measure.
When all was said and done, the Vikings went 0-5 SU and ATS last season, and the trend increased to 0-15-1 since 2016.
Off of playing the 14th-easiest schedule in 2019, the Vikings have the 13th-easiest in 2020. It’s a schedule that features only four teams forecast to produce over nine wins (Seahawks, Cowboys, Buccaneers, and Saints). From an offensive perspective, they faced the fifth-easiest schedule of defenses in 2019 and are projected to face the fifth-easiest schedule of defenses in 2020.
The problem for the Vikings is they play two primetime games and both are on the road (in Seattle and in Chicago) and Kirk Cousins’s play in primetime has been well documented (last year he was 1-5 in non-Sunday games unless Sunday Night Football). Because the Vikings play the AFC South, they face the only two dome teams in the entire AFC (as of 2019) and they play on the road against both the Colts and Texans while hosting the Titans and Jaguars. They also play dome road games in New Orleans and Detroit. Meaning they play just two of 10 non-divisional games outdoors (Seattle and Tampa Bay). One of the major benefits the Vikings have enjoyed has been the crowd noise impacting their home field advantage since moving into their new stadium in 2016. Minnesota has a 24-9 record and is 21-9-3 ATS (70%) at home, which is the best home cover rate in the NFL since 2016. If there are no fans or a reduced number, the reflection of their noise waves off the acoustically designed roof back down onto the playing surface will absolutely hurt the Vikings home field. And while the Vikings have the best cover rate in the NFL at home since 2016, they are just 16-17-1 on the road, covering only 15 of 34 games.</p>
