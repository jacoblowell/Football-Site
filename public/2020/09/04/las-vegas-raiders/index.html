<p>The Raiders produced a ton of efficiency on offense thanks to first down and third down decision making.
On first downs in the first three quarters, whether this was planned or dictated by
personnel, the Raiders had the NFL’s highest run rate into six or fewer man boxes and into seven-man boxes. The NFL average was a 38% run rate into six or fewer man boxes b .c and 56% into seven-man boxes on first down. The Raiders were at 52% and 68%,
respectively.<br />
They averaged 5.0 YPC into six-man boxes and 6.2 YPC into seven-man boxes. On
average, they were at 5.6 YPC, 49% success, and 0.05 EPA/attempt on first down rushes
into boxes with seven or fewer men. The NFL average was 4.7 YPC, 48% success, and the highest overall run rates on first down in the first three quarters. They went 62% run, Ab.</p>
<p>As a result of their run heavy rate into anything but 8+ man boxes, the Raiders had one of which was third-highest in the NFL, narrowly ahead of the Ravens and just behind the
Titans and Redskins.</p>
<p>Because they performed better than average on these runs, their first downs had a higher
floor than most teams. A high run rate with better than average performance means it was unlikely the Raiders would face second and 9 or 10 yards to go after a first down run.
To compliment the higher floor, their first down passing game, though used at the third-lowest rate, was extremely efficient. They averaged 8.1 YPA, a 63% success rate, and 0.14 EPA/att. The NFL average was 7.8 YPA, 56% success, and 0.08 EPA/att.
As a result of the efficiency through the air and ground, and a high rate of rushing to reduce incompletions on first down, the Raiders ranked first in the NFL in yards-to-go on second down, with only 7.3 yards to go on average (NFL average was 7.9). Number two in the NFL was Baltimore, another efficiently run-heavy team.
The beauty about the NFL is there are more than one way to skin a cat, and it’s not just rushing that sets up second and more manageable. The teams with the third and fifth-shortest average yards to go on second down were the Eagles and Saints, both of which ranked above average in first down pass rate (Saints were the third-most pass-heavy team in the first half of games).
But this strategy worked extremely well for the Raiders. And thanks to acceptable (though not brilliant) performance on second downs, the Raiders also found themselves with the shortest average yards-to-go on third down — 6.2 yards, over a yard better than the NFL average of 7.3 yards to go.
That leads into the next intelligent and unique thing they did on third downs — a different strategy than most teams implement.
An interesting way to look at third down performance is to analyze how deep a quarterback is passing based on yardage needed. Subtracting average air yardage from to-go yardage, we can calculate the “excess air yardage” or EAY. Segregating out buckets of to-go yardage and eliminating those over 10 yards, we have buckets of short (1-2 yards), medium (3-6 yards), long (7-9 yards), and “10” (10 yards). Look at the difference between what the Raiders were doing with their passing game and the NFL average in this next exercise, as I list the EAY.
Short – NFL: 4.6 EAY Short – Raiders: 8.0 EAY
Medium – NFL: 3.5 EAY Medium – Raiders: 2.8 EAY
Long – NFL: 2.3 EAY Long – Raiders: -0.5 EAY
“10” – NFL: 1.8 EAY “10” – Raiders: -5.2 EAY
Last year, the Raiders’ 8.0 excess air yardage on third and short passes ranked second-highest in the NFL and was well above average. Needing just 1-2 yards, they averaged 10 air yards per attempt.
But on every other distance to go, they were well short of the NFL average.
Combining third downs from 7-10 yards together, the Raiders were the most conservative offense in the NFL. No team threw it shorter of the yardage to gain than the Raiders. Their passes averaged just 6.8 air yards vs the NFL average of 10.7. The NFL average was passing the ball 2.2 air yards beyond the sticks, but the Raiders passed the ball 1.4 yards short of the sticks.
It’s a fascinating strategy – going so aggressive on short yardage passes and getting more conservative on longer to-go situations. Excluding 3rd and more than 10 yards to go, the league average was a 48% conversion rate on third down passes in general, and the Raiders were at 58%, which was first in the NFL.
When needing just 1-2 yards, even though the Raiders threw the deepest aDOT in the NFL, they converted 65% of these passes with an EPA/att of 0.70 (sixth-highest). The league average was a 66% conversion rate and only 0.15 EPA/att.</p>
<p>On the third downs of 7-10 yards to go, the league average was a 38% conversion rate and 0.24 EPA/att. The Raiders’ strategy didn’t help much from a conversion rate (38%) but they did average 0.52 EPA/att, fifth-highest in the NFL.
In both the short and long yardage third downs, the Raiders first down conversion rate was on-par with league average but they were top-6 in EPA/att.
Where the Raiders crushed it was in medium yardage situations. The Raiders threw the ball with 2.8 EAY, which ranked ninth-shortest (avg was 3.5 EAY). But they converted 68% of these (nearly identical to their short yardage passes) and gained 0.76 EPA/att. The league average was a 52% conversion rate and 0.23 EPA/att. The Raiders ranked first in both conversion rate and EPA/att.
The atypical approach the Raiders took to third downs when passing really benefited them in 2019, and more teams could look into their formula.</p>
<p>It has also led to very few third down interceptions. This, too, is atypical from the NFL average. The league average is a higher interception rate progressing from first down to second down to third down.
But one look at the Raiders’ passing interceptions by down the last two years tells a different story:
2018:
1st down: 5 INTs 2nd down: 5 INTs 3rd down: 0 INTs
2019:
1st down: 3 INTs 2nd down: 4 INTs 3rd down: 1 INT
With the exception of going deep on third and short, most of the Raiders’ passing attack in 2019 was extremely conservative in nature.
Derek Carr’s average completed air yards per attempt was 4.9, which ranked 35th of 39 QBs. His air yards to the sticks (the amount of air yards ahead or behind the first down marker on all attempts for a passer) ranked 37th of 39. His aggressiveness ranking (amount of passing attempts a quarterback makes that are into tight coverage) ranked 38th of 39.
Carr’s expected completion rank, which is based on receiver separation from the nearest defender, where the receiver is on the field, and the separation the passer had at time of throw from the nearest pass rusher, ranked second of 39. That further emphasizes how Carr was finding the most open men and rarely looking to force the issue offensively.
Looking at the run game, while the Raiders were intelligent when they ran, they used a first round pick on a running back last year. It’s too soon to tell how it will turn out for them, but the year one results were mixed.
The Raiders faced the NFL’s third-easiest schedule of run defenses but ranked 20th in rushing efficiency and 28th in explosive rushing offense.</p>
<p>Josh Jacobs ranked 22nd on early downs, identical to DeAndre Washington, and Jacobs recorded the exact same overall success rate of 50%. With all of the beneficial situational rushing the Raiders did and the 30th ranked run schedule, it is slightly surprising they finished below average in rushing efficiency, and does not bode particularly well against a tougher schedule of run defenses in 2020.
The 2019 Raiders defense literally ranked bottom five in almost every single key metric, and ranked dead last in the most important ones, including EDSR, overall success, and the red zone, to name a few. This was despite the fact the Raiders played just the 20th toughest schedule of opposing offenses. They also got really lucky with opposing quarterbacks. Before the season, I expected the 2019 Raiders defense to play the 13th-toughest schedule of passing offenses. But then Andrew Luck went down so they faced Jacoby Brissett (Raiders won). The next week, instead of facing the Bears’ starter, the Raiders were able to face Chase Daniel (Raiders won). Instead of facing Andy Dalton, the Raiders faced Ryan Finley (Raiders won). They also faced rookie Gardner Minshew instead of Nick Foles, and rookie Drew Lock instead of Joe Flacco. (In hindsight, both may have been slight upgrades.)
In total, the Raiders played six of 16 games against quarterbacks not intended to be the starter, and of the Raiders’ seven wins, three were against backups. Those wins over Brissett, Daniel, and Finley were each only by one-score. And speaking of one-score games, the Raiders went 7-3 in one-score games (likely to regress) and 100% of their seven wins on the season came by one score. That’s not a positive heading into 2020.
The Raiders went on a massive spending spree on the defensive side of the ball in free agency. After fielding the second-least expensive defense in both 2018 and 2019 (which produced disastrous results), the Raiders went all out and added linebacker Cory Littleton ($35M), edge Carl Nassib ($25M), linebacker Nick Kwiatkoski ($21M), safety Jeff Heath ($6M), defensive tackle Maliek Collins ($6M), and a handful of others. Their defense now ranks 14th in cap dollars, a huge change from the last two seasons.
The Raiders were projected to face one of the toughest schedules in 2019 by my pre-season metrics, but thanks, in part, to some of the quarterback changes highlighted above, they played an easier than average schedule in 2019. But in 2020, they face the fourth-toughest schedule and have the third-toughest schedule increase when comparing 2019 to 2020. The toughest part for the Raiders is they start the season from Week 1 to 5 playing the NFL’s toughest schedule of pass defenses. And the schedule stays the same over the first 11 weeks, as the Raiders pass offense plays the toughest schedule of pass defenses.
Last year, the Raiders played nine games against top-half pass defenses and they went 2-7 in these games (5-2 against bottom-half pass defenses). Considering they start the season with six straight top-half pass defenses and eight in their first 10 games, it will be imperative to deliver better results in 2020. Things get much easier to close the season, with just one pass defense ranked above 18th in their final six games. Facing such a tough schedule of pass defenses over the first 11 weeks, the Raiders will have to rely more on their run game. They face the seventh-easiest schedule of run defenses in 2020.</p>
<p>The Raiders had some positives throwing the ball a year ago. The team was fourth in the NFL in success rate (50%) through the air while Derek Carr set career-highs in completion rate (70.4%) and yards per pass attempt (7.9). The Raiders ranked sixth in yards per passing play (7.0 yards) and 12th in EPA via passing offense. While they were efficient in successful plays with minimal turnovers and sacks, Carr was again conservative in nature and the Raiders struggled to generate explosive plays, ranked 27th in yards to success rate and 23rd in yards above success rate. Carr’s average depth of target was just 6.6 yards, which ranked 30th in the league. With improved playmakers incoming, the Raiders have put Carr in a good position to be more aggressive, while adding Marcus Mariota as insurance and competition to the position.</p>
<p>The Raiders had an efficient passing game, 11th in yards per pass attempt (8.5 yards) and success rate (53%), but they threw to their wideouts just 43% of the time, which was 30th in the league. Through that, Raiders wideouts combined for 13.3 targets (30th), 8.8 receptions (28th), and 114.4 yards (29th) per game. The team added both Henry Ruggs (12th overall) and Bryan Edwards (81st) to the wide receiver room this season to go along with Hunter Renfrow and Tyrell Williams. The team was also third in yards per attempt (8.8 yards) and success (62%) targeting their tight ends as Darren Waller led the team in targets (117), receptions (80), and receiving yards (1,145), throwing to tight ends 33% of the time, the third-highest rate in the NFL.</p>
<p>As a team, the Raiders checked in 12th in success rate (49%), 18th in EPA, and 19th in yards per carry (4.3) in 2019. The Raiders used the 24th overall pick on Josh Jacobs last year and rewarded their decision with 1,316 yards from scrimmage and seven touchdowns in 13 games played while averaging 5.0 yards per touch. Jacobs was above league average in success rate (50%), which was sixth among all 18 running backs with 200 or more carries a year ago. DeAndre Washington was second on the team with 144 touches, leaving via free agency. In an effort to replace Washington, the Raiders added Lynn Bowden via the draft and Devontae Booker in free agency to go along with Jalen Richard, leaving Jacobs once again to be a workhorse on the ground.</p>
<p>Where Josh Jacobs can take a step forward in year two
Josh Jacobs had a sensational rookie season, ranking eighth at the position in yards from scrimmage per game (101.2 yards) and 16th in PPR points per game (14.7). On the ground, Jacobs was a terror. Only Derrick Henry (102.7 yards) and Nick Chubb (93.4 yards) rushed for more yards per game than Jacobs did in 2019 (88.5 yards). Despite missing three games, no running back forced more missed tackles than Jacobs on the season, who forced a missed tackle once every 3.5 carries. When active, Jacobs accounted for 66.9% of the Raiders team rushing attempts, a rushing share that would have ranked seventh over the course of a full season.
But the one area that held Jacobs back as an RB2 in points per game was his lack of involvement in the passing game. Jacobs caught 20-of-27 targets for 166 yards as a rookie. His 2.8 receiving points per game ranked 55th at the position as 81.9% of his fantasy output stemmed via rushing production. Among top-24 scoring backs on the season, only Marlon Mack (86.7%) and Derrick Henry (84.9%) were as dependent on rushing output to carry their fantasy production.
In games active, Jacobs ran 147 pass routes (41st at the position those weeks) compared to 161 for Jalen Richard. That lack of receiving involvement hurt his floor (6-of-13 weeks outside of the top-24) while failing to enhance his ceiling (five top-12 scoring weeks). In his nine games without a touchdown, Jacobs averaged just 10.5 fantasy points and was the average RB28.4 in scoring those weeks. Behind Jacobs, the Raiders have limited rushing options in Jalen Richard, Devontae Booker, and Lynn Bowden. Booker (289-1,103-6) and Richard (233-1,175-3) have tallied career rushing lines that rival what Jacobs has done (242-1,150-7) in just one NFL season on the ground. But both backs carry receiving acumen while Bowden is a converted wide receiver.
Can Darren Waller repeat his 2019 season?
After four troubled years since being drafted in 2015, Darren Waller broke out in a major way in 2019 for the Raiders. Waller finished third among all tight ends in targets (117) while trailing only Travis Kelce in receptions (90) and receiving yards (1,145). Waller was one of just five tight ends to lead his team in targets on the season while his 46 more targets than the next closest Raider (Hunter Renfrow) ranked 11th in the league in terms of target advantage over the next highest target in the league.
Renfrow’s involvement in the offense developed into a bit of a thorn for Waller over the course of the season. Waller did his best work early and late in the season when Hunter Renfrow was either inactive or yet to still find a role in the offense early. Waller was the average weekly TE14 with only two games of double-digit PPR points in the final six games with Renfrow active. His opportunities still held steady as Waller did still have 18% of the team targets in those games, but he accounted for 25% of the team targets with Renfrow absent Weeks 13-15 and averaged 16.1 fantasy points per game those weeks as opposed to 9.7 points per game over his final six games played with Renfrow active.
Waller was low in the scoring department, finding the end zone just three times, and his expected touchdown total off of expected target opportunities was actually just 3.9. With the Raiders adding more weaponry in the passing game this offseason, Waller will have to contend with more than just Renfrow in 2020.</p>
<p>After falling to the fifth-round because of a heart condition discovered at the NFL Combine, Maurice Hurst has turned into the disruptor he was projected to be coming out of Michigan. Last season, Hurst ranked sixth in pressure rate among 97 defensive tackles with at least 100 pass rushes per SIS. Free agent signing Maliek Collins ranked fourth among defensive tackles in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate last season. With Hurst and Collins, the Raiders have a disruptive duo with decent depth behind them.
The Raiders spent a first- and fourth-round pick on the edge last season and got production that matched, just with the players and picks swapped. Maxx Crosby might not be a consistent 10-plus sack player but he showed he can be a plus contributor as a pass rusher. Clelin Ferrell, the fourth overall pick, did not show that. Carl Nassib, signed to a three-year deal in the offseason, had an impressive 2018 but was less effective as the No. 3 in Tampa Bay last season.
Vegas completely reshaped its linebacking corps through free agency with the signings of Cory Littleton and Nick Kwiatowski. Both excel in coverage, which is something the Raiders have sorely lacked in the middle of the defense — they were among the worst in the league against opposing tight ends last season. Even backups like Te’Von Coney have shown good coverage skills, so the Raiders finally look set with a modern look at the position. Third-round pick Tanner Muse was a safety/linebacker hybrid at Clemson and projects to play closer to the line of scrimmage with the Raiders.
Vegas completely reworked its cornerback depth chart this offseason. Lamarcus Joyner has been a slot/safety but the Raiders appear to want to keep him in the slot for 2019. Prince Amukamara was a late-May signing after a deal with Eli Apple fell through earlier in the offseason. Damon Arnette was a surprise first-round pick, but his coverage metrics were pretty solid in his final college season at Ohio State. In the fourth round, the Raiders added ballhawk Amik Robertson, who had 17 passes defensed as an undersized corner at Louisiana Tech. 2019 second-round pick Trayvon Mullen is the leading returner but he was below average as a rookie on the outside last season.
At safety, Jonathan Abram is a wild player and while it can be a positive, it led to a season-ending injury in Week 1. Damarious Randall bounced around the defense with a few bad coordinators in Cleveland, but will likely return to a more traditional safety role. Erik Harris filled in well after Abram was lost for the season last year and could provide good depth in three-safety looks. Jeff Heath rounds out the depth chart.</p>
