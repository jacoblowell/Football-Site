<p>At the time of writing the Colts chapter for last year’s book, Indianapolis was projected to finish first in the AFC South, record 9.5 wins, and the fifth-highest odds to win the Super
conditions. They were a team on the come-up, and ready to take the next step.</p>
<p>Bowl. They had Andrew Luck, the fourth-highest graded QB from the 2018 season and .</p>
<p>were off a 10-win season that ended with a road playoff loss against the Chiefs in difficult. But then Andrew Luck retired.</p>
<p>The Colts’ odds to win the Super Bowl dropped from +1000 to +8000, shifting from the
fifth-most likely team to win the Super Bowl to 24th. Their odds to win the AFC South
dropped from being the favorites at +125 to finishing last at +600. Their forecasted wins
dropped from 9.5 down to 7.5.</p>
<p>Luck’s 2018 season gave the Colts plenty of reasons for optimism. After missing the 2017
season with injury, he returned at the start of the 2018 season, his first with Frank Reich
calling plays, and recorded:</p>
<p>his career-best QBR
his career-best passer rating
his career-best completion rate</p>
<p>He won Comeback Player of the Year. He was healthy and happy entering 2019. But Luck suffered a mysterious calf or ankle injury in the 2019 offseason. He was in pain for weeks, tried resting and rehabbing, but made no progress and it wasn’t responding to treatment. And then shockingly, Luck retired at the age of 29.
He shared many reasons, but key among them was the burden of the injuries he sustained, and “four years of this ‘injury -&gt; pain -&gt; rehab’ cycle.”</p>
<p>Even entering that incredible 2018 season, he admitted to being a “miserable SOB” when he was 600 days into rehab, trying to get ready for the season. At his press conference, Luck talked about the 2016 season. He played through a lot of pain that year, too. He reflected back to that season, saying:
“I’ve been stuck in this process. I haven’t been able to live the life I want to live. It’s taken the joy out of this game and after 2016, when I played in pain and was unable to regularly practice, I made a vow to myself that I would never go down that path again. I find myself in a similar situation and the only way for me is to remove myself from football and this cycle I’ve been in. I’ve come to the proverbial fork in the road and I made the vow to myself that if I ever entered this situation again, I would choose the innocence.”
Without Luck, the Colts promoted Jacoby Brissett to take over. Again. Brissett led the 2017 Colts to a 4-12 record. But I noticed something about that 2017 Colts team that not many outside that building noticed. I called it “The Unbelievable Story of the 2017 Colts” and you can read it in its entirety. Bottom line, the 2017 Colts went 4-12 but trailed in only six games at halftime. They were the only team in the last 30 years to lose seven or more games that they led at halftime. They led entering the fourth quarter in nine of 16 games, but through predictable playcalling with a fourth-quarter lead and bad defense, and a sprinkle of Brissett’s late-game issues, the Colts won just four games.
I thought we shouldn’t write off the 2019 Colts. I thought they might surprise some people, who had no confidence in Brissett. And through eight weeks, that was largely correct. They sat 5-2 through Week 8. They beat the Chiefs in Kansas City, handing Patrick Mahomes just his second regular season home loss of his career. They also defeated the other 2019 playoff teams they faced: the Texans and Titans. They only lost once against the spread in their first six games.
Imagine this: through Week 8, the Indianapolis Colts would have earned a first-round bye as the No. 2 seed in the AFC, behind the 8-0 Patriots.
And then things started to fall apart. They were due to play the 2-4 Steelers, also starting a backup quarterback, and the 0-8 Dolphins in their next two games. The 5-2 Colts dropped both games and that was just the beginning. After the 5-2 start, the Colts went 2-7 the rest of the way.
Over their first seven games, the Colts led at halftime in four games and won all four. They led entering the fourth quarter in three games and won all three. The only win which saw a fourth-quarter comeback was Week 8 against the Broncos. But prior to that, if they had a lead, they kept it.
That’s the way things go for most teams. A team with a lead at halftime wins just under 80% of the time. A lead to start the fourth quarter bumps that up to 83%.
But after the first half of the season, something went bad for the Colts. Quite bad.</p>
<p>Over the 5-2 Colts’ final nine games, they led either at halftime or entering the fourth quarter in seven games!
The only teams with more late leads (led to start the third or fourth quarter) after Week 8 were the Chiefs and Ravens. That’s it. The 49ers also held late leads in seven games. Every other team held late leads in fewer games.
Winning games with late leads was not a problem for the Colts earlier in the year: the Colts won 100% of the time earlier in the season, 90% of the time the prior season, and the NFL overall wins 80% of the time.
But the Colts went 2-5 in those seven games. They blew leads to the Steelers in Week 9 (lost by 2), the Texans in Week 12 (lost by 3), the Titans in Week 13 (lost by 14), the Buccaneers in Week 14 (lost by 3), and the Jaguars in Week 17 (lost by 18).</p>
<p>Of the 608 team-seasons since division realignment in 2002, only 146 times (24%) did a team hold late leads in at least seven games from Week 8 onward. The Colts are the only team in the NFL to win less than 35% of those games. Their 2-5 (29%) record is the worst in the NFL. In fact, even going back 30 years, no team has a worse record.
A lot of things factored into this. Turnovers, playcalling, and talent.
Over the first half of the season, the Colts had just two games with two turnovers and zero with three. In the second half of the season, they had five games with two or more turnovers and three games with three turnovers.
Over the first half of the season, the Colts were solid on early downs with a second half lead.
They averaged just 6.5 yards to go on third downs, the sixth-lowest rate in the NFL. And they had a 42% conversion rate on these plays, the 12th best in the NFL.</p>
<p>But over the second half of the season, they averaged 8.9 yards to go on these plays. Substantially worse. Remarkably, their conversion rate was nearly identical (43%), the 11th best in the NFL.
The first half of the season, they went 35% pass on these early down plays, just shy of the 38% NFL average.
But in the second half of the season, they upped that to 41% pass. Their early down runs generated 6.4 YPC and a 55% success rate and 10.6 EPA but early down passes generated just 33% success, 5.7 YPA, and -8.5 EPA.
Another issue for them over the second half of the season was injuries. The Colts’ big offensive signing last year was wide receiver Devin Funchess, but he was lost after Week 1. Their best offensive draft pick was second-round receiver Parris Campbell. He broke his hand, suffered a sports hernia, missed a lot of time, and played in just one game after Week 9. The Colts’ projected 2019 11 personnel receivers played in one game together, Week 1.
The biggest loss was clearly WR1 T.Y. Hilton. As the Colts started out 5-2, he played in six of their first seven games (missing the loss to the Raiders in Week 4).
He missed five of the team’s next six games with injuries, which is when the season derailed itself as they lost five of those next six games. All told, when Hilton played, the Colts went 6-4. When he didn’t play, the Colts went 1-5.
And the team also had to deal with the loss of tight end Eric Ebron, who missed the team’s final five games of the season (they went 1-4).
Primarily on account of the lack of talent at receiver, the Colts shifted to become a more run-centric team. In 2018, with Luck and slightly healthier receivers, the Colts went 65% pass in one-score games, the second-highest rate in the NFL. But last year, without Luck and without receiving talent or depth, the Colts shifted to only 52% pass in one-score games, which ranked second-lowest. Their shift from pass heavy to run heavy was, unsurprisingly, the largest shift in the NFL last year.
Compare Luck in 2018 to Brissett in 2019. Luck saw 59% of his passing yardage come via the air, seventh-most in the NFL, whereas Brissett saw just 46%, ranked 43rd. Luck averaged 0.9% CPOE, meaning his completion rate was better than expected based on player tracking data looking at pass location, defender proximity, and state of QB. Brissett averaged -4.0% CPOE, ranking 36 of 39 quarterbacks last year.
Brissett was extremely susceptible to pressure. His accuracy was 79.9% from a clean pocket but only 57.5% when pressured (31st). Brissett brought some of that pressure on himself when he held the ball in the pocket. His 2.03 average seconds to throw was the second-longest among those 39 qualified quarterbacks in 2019.
Looking at the team’s EDSR chart, over that first half of the season, the Colts only had solid EDSR wins in two of seven games, yet went 5-2. Over the second half of the season, they won the EDSR battle in five of nine games, yet went 2-7.
Reflecting back to the 2018 Colts, a similar pattern of EDSR performance was seen. Over the first five games, the Colts lost the EDSR battle in all five games, but did much better down the stretch, winning it in 10 of their final 11 games. In that season, winning the EDSR battle translated into wins, which wasn’t the case in 2019.
However, the point remains, this is the third year that Frank Reich will be working with a new quarterback in his system. 2018 was Year 1 with Andrew Luck, 2019 was Year 1 with Jacoby Brissett, and 2020 will be Year 1 with Philip Rivers. In both prior years, the Colts started slow offensively. Obviously, Luck’s season can be excused due to his injury and rehab and likely wasn’t 100% to start the season. But emphasis must be placed on trying to avoid a slower start to the season with Rivers. Over the last five years combined, Rivers’s Chargers have started out 9-16 (36%) during the first five weeks of the season. In his career, he’s 33-35 over the first five weeks and 56-29 from Week 12 onward. Figuring out how to get Rivers and this offense started fast should be a paramount objective.
My May 2019 forecast for the Colts was the ninth-easiest schedule in 2019. It ended up being third-easiest. But without a quarterback, the Colts lost six games by seven or fewer points and produced a losing record. Apparently, the respect for the Colts isn’t there in 2020, as they get just one primetime game, a short-week tilt in Tennessee.
In 2020, the Colts are fortunate to play the NFL’s easiest schedule, and it starts off nicely for them: a road game against whatever the Jaguars trot onto the field this season followed by two home games, against the Vikings and Jets. Over the first eight weeks of the season, the Colts face, by far, the easiest schedule in the NFL, playing just two teams forecast to even record a winning record. That said, while some teams may benefit from easy schedules of run defenses to start the season, the Colts do have to play three top-half run defenses in their first four games.
After Week 5, the Colts play just two games outdoors the rest of the season: Week 10 in Tennessee (on Thursday) and Week 16 in Pittsburgh. They play three road games in domes. Since 2000, the Colts are 21-10 (68%) on the road in domes and 71-69 (51%) on the road outdoors. From Week 5 onward, the Colts face just two teams that finished above-average in run defense last season: the Steelers and Titans. Every other opponent was below-average, giving the Colts the fifth-easiest schedule of run defenses starting in Week 5.</p>
<p>With the surprise of a late-summer retirement from Andrew Luck, the Colts were forced to turn things over to Jacoby Brissett once again in 2019. The results were not pretty as Indianapolis ranked 19th in EPA through the air, 25th in the league in success rate through the air (42%), 31st in yards created above success rate, and 28th in yards per pass attempt (6.5 Y/A). Reuniting Philip Rivers with Colts head coach Frank Reich and offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni, who were both with the Chargers, the Colts will be starting a different Week 1 quarterback than the season prior for the fourth straight season. In 2019, Rivers and the Chargers passing game finished fifth in the league in success rate (49%), 11th in EPA via their passing offense and ninth in yards per pass attempt (7.8). While the receiving talent in Indianapolis is not an apples to apples comparison to what Rivers had in Los Angeles, Rivers is an upgrade over what Brissett provided a year ago.</p>
<p>Through multiple injuries and subpar quarterback play, the Colts’ passing game struggled in all capacities. The team ranked 30th in success rate targeting their wideouts (45%) and 24th in yards per pass attempt to their wide receivers (7.2 yards). Lead receiver T.Y. Hilton missed six games and second-round draft pick Parris Campbell missed nine as 2018 undrafted rookie Zach Pascal tied for the team in targets on the season with 72. He matched targets with Jack Doyle as Eric Ebron missed five games and the Colts ranked 21st in yards per pass attempt to their tight ends (6.9 yards). With a healthy Hilton and Campbell, paired with the additions of Michael Pittman Jr. and Trey Burton to go along with Rivers, the passing game will rebound.</p>
<p>The Colts had success running the football in 2019, ranking fifth in EPA on the ground, 11th in yards per carry (4.5 yards), fifth in success rate (53%), and seventh in rate of yards created above success. Marlon Mack had 1,011 and 1,173 yards from scrimmage in the past two seasons, but has also missed multiple games in each of his first three seasons. Entering the final season of his rookie contract paired with the missed game over the past two seasons, the Colts used a second-round pick (41st overall) on Jonathan Taylor. No running back in this class has a more decorated career usage background that Taylor does. He handled 968 touches over three seasons at Wisconsin for over 2,000 yards from scrimmage in all three years.</p>
<p>Is this Backfield Solely for Jonathan Taylor to dominate as a rookie?
There was no pure runner available in this draft class than Jonathan Taylor. While Taylor was at Wisconsin from 2017-2019, he had 1,715 more rushing yards than the next highest player in college football over that span.
While the touch count is high, there is really no need to have that factor in as a concern. On a per game level, Taylor’s 23.6 touches per game in college were fewer than Adrian Peterson (24.9) and Ray Rice (24.9) handled per game while his career touch count is below that of LaDainian Tomlinson (986), Michael Turner (983), DeAngelo Williams (1,039), and David Johnson (1,007) to name a few successful high-volume backs in college.
The only remaining blemish for Taylor is will he catch a ton of passes in the NFL or fall into a Derrick Henry-esque type of a role within an offense. Taylor improved last season, catching 26 passes after just 16 through two seasons. That was good for 10.6% of his team’s receptions, which ranked 10th among all 30 backs invited to the combine. But his usage in that area at the next level is still to be determined as Pro Football Focus credited him with eight career drops on 50 catchable passes. Taylor also has been a limited pass protector (33 snaps in protection last season), something that can prevent him playing full-time alongside a veteran quarterback.
Rivers has peppered backfields with targets before, with the Chargers ranking first, third, and 11th in backfield targets over the past three seasons, but neither Taylor nor Mack fit the mold of a Darren Sproles, Danny Woodhead, or Austin Ekeler. That keeps the door open for Nyheim Hines to muddy things further, but he himself has had a ton of early struggles in the league. Hines managed to catch another 44 passes a year ago, giving him 107 receptions through two years in the NFL. The downside is that Hines had his snap share significantly reduced last season (32%) from 2018 (44%) by this same coaching staff and he has averaged just 7.0 yards per catch and 5.2 yards per target on those passing game opportunities.
Mack has been a solid back for the Colts the past two seasons and a solid find in the fourth round of 2017. As good of a runner as Mack has been, he has been 59th and 79th in receiving points per game over the past two seasons with a combined 31-185-1 receiving line and 5.9 yards per catch. Mack did catch 65 passes in college for 7.7 yards per catch and did catch 21 passes as a rookie for 10.7 yards per reception, so he has caught passes before. This staff just has not used him in that capacity for the past two seasons. He has also struggled in pass protection, ranking 58th of 60 backs in Pass blocking efficiency per Pro Football Focus.
It is unlikely that Taylor will have a full-time, workhorse role right away in Week 1 with Mack as a threat to touches on the ground and Hines still being used on passing downs. But both leave a lot on the table in the passing game, while Mack has been unable to stay healthy, missing multiple games each year of his career so far. With Taylor’s supreme rushing acumen and the door still open for anyone here to be better in the passing game, Taylor is a back to expect to pick up steam as the season moves in terms of percentage of team touches he sees per week.</p>
<p>The Colts didn’t have a great defense in 2019, but there is a lot of young talent that could be on the brink of a breakout on every level of the unit. Indianapolis made a splash at quarterback but the biggest move — parting with a first-round pick plus a massive contract extension — came with the addition of DeForest Buckner. Buckner immediately upgrades the interior with a dangerous disruptor next to Denico Autry, who was already eighth among defensive tackles in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate last season.
There isn’t much depth to speak of behind them, but Buckner-Autry is one hell of a 1-2 punch that will likely see the field for most of Indianapolis’s defensive snaps. As long as both aren’t off the field at the same time, the line will be ok. Kemoko Turay had a promising rookie season on the edge in 2018 but made it through just four games in 2019 and finished the year on injured reserve. Justin Houston was a welcome positive presence on the edge for Indianapolis, but it was rookie Ben Banogu who finished with the highest pressure rate on the team last season, per SIS. Banogu had limited snaps but improved as the season went on and should be in line for a bigger role in 2020. Al-Quadin Muhammed also ran a higher pressure rate than Houston as a rotational edge. While Banogu could break out and Turay could return to health, there’s clearly room here for another edge somewhere in the middle rounds of the draft.
At linebacker, the Colts are still benefiting from their third-round steal of Darius Leonard two seasons ago. He makes the middle of the defense work with both tackling and coverage ability. Bobby Okereke might be a third-round steal in his own right. The 2019 rookie was a plus in coverage and should emerge with more playing time in the coming season. Indianapolis played 34% of their snaps in base last season, which was the third-highest rate in the league per SIS. The other starting linebacker is Anthony Walker, also a good coverage linebacker. It’s a good starting trio with decent depth behind them.
As a second-round pick, Rock Ya-Sin was one of the league’s better rookie corners last season. He was about average in Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap. For a position that usually takes a year or two to fully develop, that’s a good sign. Marvell Tell was also an impressive rookie who had some really positive flashes with a couple of rookie mistakes. He could work his way into more playing time in 2020. Kenny Moore should also be an above average starter — he finished between Byron Jones and Marcus Peters in Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap last season. There are a number of corners on the depth chart, but the quality is the question. The biggest is Xavier Rhodes, who was routinely torched last season with the Vikings.
Malik Hooker played 13 games last season and showed the extended promise he had flashed in previous injury-shortened seasons. Hooker can be one of the most dynamic deep safeties if healthy and the hope is that he can continue in the final year of his rookie deal (fifth-year option pending). Khari Willis was also great last season. The problem is depth. Tell could pitch in some at safety if needed, though that wouldn’t be suggested if he continues to play well at corner. The Colts took Utah defensive back Julian Blackmon in the third round, who has experience at both corner and safety. He has range that looks to play well in the backend of the secondary.</p>
