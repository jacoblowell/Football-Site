      <description>The Falcons made it to the 2016 Super Bowl thanks to Kyle Shanahan’s offense. But the defense was very bad that year. Quinn’s first defensive coordinator was Richard Smith. Smith was fired after two years. Quinn effectively did it mid-way in the 2016 Super Bowl season, as he relieved Smith of playcalling prior to Week 13. But after the 2016 season, Quinn promoted secondary coach Marquand Manuel to the role of DC.</description>

      <description>I don’t think many people were as high on Lamar Jackson coming out of Louisville as I was. I was hoping he would fall to the Ravens at No. 25. He did, but they did their market research and predicted they would still be able to land him at the end of the first round.
.In the summer of 2018, the Ravens were trying to figure out how to sell tickets and prevent no-shows at the stadium.</description>

      <description>Joe Burrow brings hope to the Bengals. .
But the Bengals will need to do more.
Last season, remarkably, the Bengals played in zero games before Week 17 where they snapped the ball over seven times from all personnel groupings combined other than 11 and 12. You could argue this was due to a lack of talent, but I would argue that given a lack of talent (particularly at the wide receiver position), that using the highest rate of 11 .</description>

      <description>“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. Sun Tzu knew the value of knowing yourself. The Browns didn’t know themselves last b year, particularly on offense. And that lack of knowledge, coupled with infighting and b ultimately insurrection amongst the coaching ranks propelled the Browns from capitalizing on their 7-9 2018 campaign.</description>

      <description>There is something to be said for a team willing to make changes before it’s too late. Far too often we see teams continue to make the same mistakes over and over and hold off on changing because they are worried about the negatives of such changes. They pessimistically view potential negatives as a worse thing to fear than the familiar
The 6-3 Bills were an offense that passed the ball 53% of the time on early downs in the first three quarters, identical to the league average.</description>

      <description>There are some situations you can see from a mile away that have very little hope. The 2019 Panthers struggling to have success after Cam Newton was done for the season was one of those situations. Make no mistake – they battled admirably, but this was not a winnable battle. Teams are built with identities. The Cam Newton-led Panthers had an identity. Before Norv and Scott Turner called plays, the way to beat the Panthers was to stop Newton’s legs.</description>

      <description>Throwing good money after bad. The sunk cost fallacy. When someone continues an endeavor as a result of previously invested resources, rather than objectively viewing rookie quarterback highly, watch as the team’s performance isn’t tragic despite mediocre bc future decisions based on their own cost-benefit. Far too often, we see teams draft a quarterback play, and then reward said quarterback with a second, more lucrative.
After Carr’s first two years, the team went 10-22 and he averaged only 6.</description>

      <description>Jason Garrett had 10 years as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. But it’s been 24 years since the Cowboys won a Super Bowl and in that span, they haven’t even made it past the Divisional round once. “America’s Team” has made the Divisional round just six times in those 24 years and are 0-6 when there. They’ve gone through a number of well-known coaches in that span, including Barry Switzer, Bill Parcells, and Wade Phillips.</description>

      <description>Watching Drew Lock enter in Week 13 and record a win over the Chargers, followed by a win over playoff qualifying Texans on the road was extremely impressive. Seeing him go 4-1 down the stretch was likewise impressive.
But beneath the surface optimism, I found more to be concerned about than otherwise anticipated.
As we know, schedule matters, often more than what is factored into anticipated results. The 2019 Broncos played the fourth-easiest schedule of opposing defenses and recorded the third-worst Early Down Success Rate (EDSR) of any offense in the NFL.</description>

      <description>After a 7-9 record in 2017 and a 6-10 record in 2018, the Packers exploded to win 13 games in 2019. That’s an increase of seven wins over their 2018 total. In the last 30 years, there have been 52 teams to improve by six or more wins from one year to the next. Only 18 of those 52 teams improved to record at least 12 wins, like the Packers (13 wins .</description>

      <description>The Texans are built like a team would be if they want to rally around a young quarterback. They have just the 23rd most cap space allotted to the position, and are top-10 in cap spending to the offensive line and wide receiver corps. You want a good, .young quarterback and you want to give him protection. From a pass blocking perspective, the Texans offensive line ranked eighth in ESPN’s .</description>

      <description>Help a young quarterback. Find out what he does well, quickly, and emphasize it. Keep him from obvious passing situations. Keep the defense guessing with your playcalls. Keep him confident by keeping him upright. And let him pass on early downs to build up his confidence. The formula to helping a young quarterback goes beyond that handful of strategies, but they get you pretty far down the road. John DeFilippo didn’t expect to be working with a young quarterback.</description>

As in, how the hell are you so damn great at football? How the hell are you capable of doing the things you do?
The man is like Neo. He sees the matrix and no matter how many Mr. Andersons he’s up against or how overwhelming the odds appear to be, he can get his team out of the jam.</description>

      <description>The Raiders produced a ton of efficiency on offense thanks to first down and third down decision making. On first downs in the first three quarters, whether this was planned or dictated by personnel, the Raiders had the NFL’s highest run rate into six or fewer man boxes and into seven-man boxes. The NFL average was a 38% run rate into six or fewer man boxes b .c and 56% into seven-man boxes on first down.</description>

The Chargers blew two second-half leads, Week 2 against the Lions and Week 3 against the Texans. They lost each game by one score and sat at 2-2. From that point through the end of the season, this team lost the EDSR battle in just one game through Week 17. That one game was vs the Bears.</description>

They should have run it much less. The 2018 Rams gained 5.9 YPC, a 62% success rate, and 0.10 EPA/carry. The 2019 Rams gained 3.5 YPC, a 36% success rate, and -0.</description>

      <description>The tank is over. Miami signed 12 players in free agency for a total of $237 million, the most of any team. How much is that, really? The team spending the second-most was essentially $100 million less (the Lions at $138 million). How does what the Dolphins spent in 2020 free agency compare to the highest spending team over the last ten years? 2020: $237 million – Dolphins 2019: $226 million – Jets 2018: $194 million – Jets 2017: $177 million – Jaguars 2016: $225 million – Jaguars 2015: $182 million – Jets 2014: $147 million – Bucs 2013: $159 million – Dolphins 2012: $162 million – Bucs 2011: $149 million – Panthers The salary cap has risen from $120 million in 2011 to $198 million in 2020, or approximately $7.</description>

      <description>The NFC North is an interesting division. The division winner Packers made the NFC Championship game and decided instead of adding a missing link to get over the hill, to draft for the future by taking a quarterback in the first round. The second-place Vikings, who also made the playoffs and upset the Saints while there, decided to overhaul the roster.

      <description>The Patriots had been absolutely dominant with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick since they joined forces in 2001. They’ve been virtually unbeatable at home, and especially at home consecutive weeks to Ryan Fitzpatrick in Week 17 and Ryan Tannehill in the Wild Card round. That two AFC East doormat quarterbacks for years were the two to end the dynasty is spectacularly ironic.
It would be hard to convince anyone back on Halloween 2019 the Patriots wouldn’t get a first-round bye and wouldn’t win a single playoff game.</description>

After Drew Brees went down with an injury in Week 2, Teddy Bridgewater started Week 3’s game in Seattle and pulled out a win. It would be his first of five straight wins. Most thought Brees would return after the bye week, but he came back two weeks ahead of schedule, in a Week 8 home start against the Cardinals.</description>

      <description>When drafting a running back second overall, you hope defenses are worried about stopping him. You hope they try to stop him by loading up the box, which in turn would free up pass efficiency. But that didn’t happen often last year. Defenses didn’t load up to stop the run out of fear for Saquon Barkley. .

      <description>Writing the Jets chapter in the 2019 preview was frustrating. The aftermath of the 2018 Jets 4-12 season saw head coach Todd Bowles get fired. His newly appointed offensive coordinator, Jeremy Bates, took over for John Morton and Bates was a disaster. I was hoping this year’s chapter would be less frustrating. After all, Adam Gase was the new head coach, and he was also the team’s playcaller. And the Jets went 7-9.</description>

      <description>When the Eagles won the 2017 Super Bowl, they had Zach Ertz healthy for all but two games, and their three starting wide receivers didn’t miss a regular season start (Alshon Jeffery, Nelson Agholor, and Torrey Smith)
Their top four receivers in receptions in 2017 were their No. 1 tight end and their top three wide receivers. Very standard and very reliable.
The speed of Smith (4.36 40-time) was something the Eagles wanted to replicate the following year after they traded him to Carolina.</description>

If it was frustrating watching them as an analyst, I cannot imagine how it was to be a fan. And we will get to the bad soon enough. But before we do, let’s take a moment to acknowledge how insane it was that the Steelers finished 8-8 and not significantly worse .</description>
