Jameis Winston has long been a conundrum. He can be outstanding at times but goes
diametrically opposite the very next play. We’ve only recently discovered he was visually
impaired as well, which further clouds the picture.
A simple example of the complications surrounding Winston: Of the 19 quarterbacks to
post above-average accuracy on targets 15+ yards downfield on early downs, Winston
and rookie Dwayne Haskins were the only two to record accuracy below 50% on these
deep targets on third down. View the CPOE graphic in this chapter to compare his deep .accuracy on early downs to that on third down.
A deeper example: It should be understandable that it is easier to produce through the air against stacked boxes than it is when defenses use light boxes. With 8+ men in the box,
only three men are left to play coverage. With six or fewer men in the box, defenses have
at least five men in coverage.
For this reason, on early downs in a game’s first three quarters, passes against 8+ men boxes gain more YPA, record more EPA, produce a higher success rate, result in a better
.
TD:INT rate, and a higher passer rating as compared to passing against six or fewer men
boxes.
Against stacked boxes (8+ defenders) Jameis Winston threw six interceptions in 2019 (early downs, quarters 1-3). The entire rest of the NFL threw only 17 interceptions.
Winston threw an interception on 7.3% of his passes while the NFL average was 1.5%.
Bruce Arians did a great job of getting the Bucs to run infrequently against such stacked boxes, something that should be avoided, especially on early downs. Leaguewide, such runs gain just 4.1 YPC with a 43% success rate as compared to runs against light boxes, which gain 5.1 YPC with a 49% success rate. Tampa ran just 52% of the time when defenses put 8+ defenders in the box, the second least in the NFL. Only the Chiefs were more intelligent.
2019 Passing Performance
     Ignoring the interceptions, Winston was great from an efficiency perspective. Against these stacked boxes he averaged 10.1 YPA with a 59% success rate, both far superior to what he averaged against light boxes.
Like Winston, Tom Brady was great passing against stacked boxes. His 2019 splits: 8+ man box: 8.4 YPA, 52% success, 109 rating
7 or fewer: 6.5 YPA, 49% success, 90 rating
The difference for Brady was that he didn’t throw the interceptions that Winston did.
Arians invited heavier boxes by using 12 personnel on early downs. Out of the 155 attempts on early downs in the first three quarters, 93 came from 12 personnel. When Arians sent out 12 personnel in these situations, defenses used six or less in the box 27 of 180 plays (15%), seven men in the box on 60 of 180 plays (33%), and 8+ men in the box on 93 of 180 plays (52%). Winson recorded a 60% success rate with 8.9 YPA on these passes.
Winston was great passing from 11 personnel against 8+ men boxes, but defenses rarely played 8+ in the box, doing so just 12% of all snaps, instead using six or fewer in the box 59% of the time.
Earlier this offseason, Arians said “we’ve always been a 12 personnel team. Ever since Pittsburgh. That’s our base offense.”
While I would love that to be true, especially for a team built like the Buccaneers, that wasn’t exactly the case, assuming you define base as the grouping that is used most and is the default standard.
Last year the Bucs used 12 on 23% of offensive snaps, only 3% above average. They used 11 personnel on 64% of snaps. On pass plays, the Bucs used 12 personnel on 17% of attempts, ranking only 1% above average.
But if we back up to look only at the first quarter, and only on early downs, we see the Bucs used 12 personnel on 37% of offensive plays, which was 10% above average and the fifth-most in the NFL.
For whatever reason, the Bucs got away from 12 after the first quarter. Their early down usage dropped from 37% to 25% in the second quarter and 26% over the remainder of the game.
The production gained from 12 was notable. Winston averaged 1.1 more YPA, 6% more success, and 23 more passer rating points when passing from Arians’s 12 personnel sets. It would be wise to feature that package not just in the first quarter (as they did in 2019) but also far more frequently the rest of the game.
Historically, teams with halftime leads win 77% of games. Teams with leads entering the fourth quarter win 83% of games. And yet Tampa Bay lost 40% of games they led at halftime and a whopping 45% of the games they led entering the fourth quarter.
They held halftime leads in 10 games and won just six. They held leads entering the fourth quarter in nine games and won just five.
To show how rare that is: in the last 30 years, only seven other teams held leads entering the fourth quarter in at least nine games but won no more than five. Out of
955 teams, it happened just seven times (0.7%) previously.

Out of 612 teams that led entering the fourth quarter in at least seven games, only 14 other teams lost at least 44% of their games.
The great news for the Buccaneers is these improbable losses are unlikely to be repeated, mostly because the reasons for the losses were primarily fourth-quarter turnovers by Jameis Winston.
In the Week 3 loss to the Giants, Tampa Bay held a three-point lead late when Winston threw an interception at the Giants’ 26-yard line. The Bucs lost by one point. Winston’s interception cost the Bucs 5.0 expected points.
In the Week 8 loss to the Titans, Tampa Bay entered the fourth quarter with the ball and a three-point lead. Winston fumbled the ball at his own 34-yard line. When down four late, Winston threw an interception at the Titans’ 25-yard line. The Bucs lost by four points. Winston’s fumble cost the Bucs 5.0 expected points and his interception cost them another 0.9 expected points.

In the Week 9 loss to the Seahawks, after a Seattle field goal to tie the game, the Bucs had the ball on the Seahawks’ 45-yard line. Winston fumbled the ball on the Seattle 48 and it was returned by the Seahawks to the Bucs’ 15-yard line. The Bucs lost in overtime by six points. Winston’s fumble cost the Bucs 7.1 expected points.
In every single one of these games, Tampa Bay led entering the fourth quarter but saw Winston generate at least one turnover which, in that single play, cost the Bucs more points than the final margin. In other words, those single events literally cost them the game. Yes, there were plays after that could have offset the expected points lost on the turnovers to change the outcome. But they were extremely costly.
In the Bucs’ Week 17 loss to the Falcons, for the first time, Winston didn’t blow that fourth quarter lead due to turnovers. That one was just good old fashioned bad play and bad playcalling. Leading by six points entering the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay had two total drives in the fourth quarter, both still with a lead. They gained a grand total of 10 yards combined on both drives. On three first down plays on the two drives, the Bucs called a run each time. On each second down play that followed, the Bucs called a pass. On each drive, they punted the ball. On each Atlanta drive following those punts, the Falcons scored.
The way they lost these games was brutal. But for 2020, the more important item to study is how they held so many leads in the first place.
It came with a combination of good enough offensive performance on early downs with great defensive performance on early downs.
That second part may come as a surprise, because the 2018 Bucs defense was trash and people likely assume that because the 2019 Bucs posted a losing record and allowed 28.1 points per game (fourth-most) they must have been trash as well. The only thing that should be trashed is the opinion of anyone you speak with who ranks defenses by points per game.
The 2018 Bucs had the sixth-most expensive defense in the NFL but ranked dead last in efficiency. The 2019 Bucs shed $20M in defensive salary cap space to rank 12th-least expensive. And guess what happened?
They went from 32nd to fifth in defensive efficiency against a tougher schedule while spending $20M less in cap space. That was in large part thanks to defensive coordinator Todd Bowles, who performed magic.

Tampa Bay’s defense ranked seventh in EDSR but ranked 32nd in yards per point allowed. Yes, their team didn’t require opposing offenses to gain many yards per point scored, but that was in large part to the terrible field position Winston gave them, or outright pick-sixes he giftwrapped. That’s not on the Bucs defense. And if Brady improves that area, which is near 100% certainty, the Bucs defense won’t rank anywhere near 32nd in yards per point scored.
In 11 games decided by fewer than 14 points, the Bucs only lost the EDSR battle in three games (and they won two of the three). That bodes extremely well for the 2020 Bucs.
They will need to improve their offensive early down success, however (21st in 2019). A big part of their overall offensive production was the third-best red zone conversion rate (65%). That ranking was notable, because an issue for Arians in Arizona was a lack of red zone production due to the style of his “no risk-it, no biscuit” offense which featured deeper throws and vertical routes.
His 2012 Colts converted just 51% of red zone trips, which ranked 21st. His first two years in Arizona, his offenses converted 52% and 44%, ranked 20th and 28th, respectively. He managed a couple better years in 2015 and 2016 (10th and sixth respectively) before ranking third-worst in his final year with Carson Palmer and the Cardinals. As such, pushing the third-best red zone rate in year one in Tampa Bay with Jameis Winston indicates Arians and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich worked on the red zone offensive structure and is something to be excited about now that Tom Brady is at the helm.
One of the biggest changes from the Patriots offense to Arians’s system is the average target depth. The Bucs averaged 10.2 air yards per pass, first in the NFL. The Patriots were down at 7.7, 21st in 2019. In 2018, they averaged 7.4, which ranked 23rd. Brady will be looking deeper more often. This could be particularly true on first down, where the Bucs averaged 13 air yards per pass (first) and the Patriots were down at 26th with 7.1. Having receivers like Mike Evans and Chris Godwin will help, a talented duo Brady has not seen in quite some time — especially compared to last year’s receiving corps in New England.
Another big change is the lack of pre-snap motion. Last year in the first three quarters of games, the Patriots used pre-snap motion on 65% of pass attempts, the second most in the NFL. The Bucs didn’t use it on 63% of attempts. Their 37% usage rate was one of the lowest in the NFL (average was 40%).
One of the biggest similarities from the Patriots offense to Arians’s system is a slightly lower rate of play-action but big production boosts off it. On early downs in the game’s first three quarters, the Bucs called play-action on 25% of dropbacks (average was 36%). But YPA improved from 7.5 to 11.7 and success improved from 51% to 57%. The Patriots used play-action ahead of only 28% of dropbacks. But their YPA improved from 6.0 to 8.4 and their success improved from 46% to 56%.

The Buccaneers led the league in passing yardage (4,845 yards) and yards per completion (13.4) while they were third in passing touchdowns (33). But due to the turnover-prone play of Jameis Winston, Tampa Bay ranked just 13th in EPA via their passing offenses while they ranked 14th in success rate (46%) through the air. Winston was the first passer to throw 30 interceptions in a season since Vinny Testaverde in 1988. Tampa Bay has replaced Winston with the league’s most decorated quarterback in Tom Brady. Brady will be 43 years old this August coming off a season in which he posted his lowest yards per pass attempt (6.6 Y/A) in a season since 2002 while his touchdown rate (3.9%) was an all-time low. Brady was 28th in aDOT (8.0) and 15th in air yards per completion (6.0) in 2019 throwing to a limited arsenal of pass catchers, something that is significantly upgraded in Tampa Bay.

The Buccaneers were led by stellar receiving campaigns by both Mike Evans (67-1,157-8) and Chris Godwin (86-1,333-9). Tampa Bay wideouts ranked fourth in the league in yards per target (9.6) and ninth in success rate (54%). The Buccaneers were also successful in getting the ball effectively to their backs in the passing game, ranking ninth in yards per target (6.3) and 13th in success rate (46%) targeting their running backs. The one area where Tampa Bay was under par was targeting tight ends. Tampa tight ends ranked 22nd in yards per target (6.3) and 19th in success rate (52%). Tampa Bay added Rob Gronkowski to the tight end group to pair up with stud wideouts in Godwin and Evans, while Brady is in place to sustain using his backfield.

Tampa Bay ranked 22nd in the league in rushing efficiency (44% success rate), 27th in explosive run rate, and 28th in expected points added via their run game in 2019. Their backs combined to rank 18th in touches per game (26.5), 20th in yards from scrimmage per game (121.5), and 24th in yards per touch (4.6). The team still has Ronald Jones (1,033 yards) and Dare Ogunbowale (303 yards) from last season. Jones ranked 41st in overall success rate on the ground (45%), but was the most explosive player in the backfield, ranking 12th in the league in explosive run rate (12%). Adding Ke’Shawn Vaughn in the third round (No. 76) and Raymond Calais in the seventh round (No. 245), the Buccaneers can replace Peyton Barber (who ranked 61st in success rate at 38%) but this backfield still has question marks entering 2020.

Can Rob Gronkowski still be a fantasy TE1?
The last time we saw Gronkowski on the field was 2018. In that season, Gronkowski dealt with a lingering ankle injury that forced him to miss three games. He had limited mobility and his play suffered from it, averaging just 3.6 receptions for 52.5 receiving yards per game. It was the fewest yards per game he had in a season outside of his rookie year. He also caught just three touchdowns on 47 receptions (4.2%) after catching a touchdown on 16.5% of his career receptions prior. Despite that down production to his own standards, Gronkowski still averaged 14.5 yards per reception, which ranked fifth among all tight ends with more than 25 receptions in 2018. Gronk also still averaged 10.1 PPR points per game in 2018, which was good for TE11 on the season per game. Entering 2020 at age 31, Gronk has not appeared in a full season since 2011 and is not the lead option in a passing game that has two prime wide receivers in Chris Godwin and Mike Evans while the team still has both O.J. Howard and Cameron Brate on the roster. Despite those negatives, there is a low bar to clear for fantasy relevancy at tight end and the passing game situation in Tampa Bay is good enough to generate a plethora of scoring opportunities.
Is Ke’Shawn Vaughn going to surpass Ronald Jones and take over the backfield?
Second-year running back Ronald Jones made a significant jump up to 203 touches and 5.1 yards per touch from his anemic rookie season usage (30 touches) and efficiency (5.1 yards per touch). Despite his improvement in year two, the Buccaneers were still reluctant to fully trust him with the offense, allowing Peyton Barber (170 touches) to carve into his workload. A big early-career thorn for Jones has been his effectiveness in pass protection. In 2019, he allowed eight pressures on 49 snaps in protection. This opened the door for Dare Ogunbowale to lead the team in pass protection snaps (72) and routes run (223) from the backfield.
In 2019, nearly no college back was asked to do as much as Ke’Shawn Vaughn across the board for his team’s offense. Vaughn accounted for 70.7% of the team non-QB carries (second in this class), 69.7% of the non-QB rushing yards (second), 36.2% of the team yards from scrimmage (third), 13.9% of the receptions (second), and scored 47.6% of the team touchdowns (second). Vaughn’s three-down ability could make him the 1A option sooner than later while the Tampa Bay backs combined for 15 touchdowns in 2019.

The Buccaneers turned into the league’s best run defense last season under defensive coordinator Todd Bowles and a big part of that came from the interior duo of Ndamukong Suh and Vita Vea. Tampa Bay wanted to run that duo back and re-signed Suh to a one-year deal after he hit the free agent market. Suh is no longer the pass rusher he used to be but Vea turned into a productive one last season, 10th in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate among defensive tackles.
Tampa also got great production off the edge. The Bucs ranked third in Pass Rush Win Rate as a team last season and Shaquil Barrett was fifth overall among edge rushers. Like the interior, the Buccaneers worked to bring back the group that showed success last season by re-signing Jason Pierre-Paul to a two-year deal and putting the franchise tag on Barrett. There’s a lot of money tied in the top two edge rushers but not much locked in past the coming season, pending a Barrett extension. Tampa will rely heavily on those two rushers off the edge, but are also one of the most blitz-heavy teams in the league. Only Baltimore (45%) rushed five or more at a higher rate than Tampa Bay last season (39%).
With a big contract for Lavonte David and a top-5 pick in Devin White, there are few teams with more invested at off-ball linebacker than the Buccaneers. David and White also play a high number of Tampa Bay’s defensive snaps — David played 99% and White played 73% last season.
Cornerback is a position of intrigue for the Buccaneers. Tampa threw a bunch of Day 2 picks over the past two drafts and found a few gems. Sean Bunting-Murphy was an above-average corner by Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap (which factors in touchdowns and interceptions), as was Jamel Dean, who was an NFL Combine standout last season and selected in the third round. Carlton Davis ran hot and cold with a low completion percentage allowed by a few big plays thrown in. No corners were added, so Tampa is comfortable with this group developing more in 2020.
Safety is easily the shakiest position on the Tampa Bay defense. Justin Evans started to break out in 2018 but missed the entire 2019 season with an Achilles injury. Without Evans, the Bucs ran with a trio of Mike Edwards, Andrew Adams, and Jordan Whitehead. They were one of the worst teams in the league defending deep passes. The Bucs added Antoine Winfield Jr., a promising safety in the second round. He sports both range and instincts to start immediately in the defensive backfield. But still, there’s no guarantee of what Evans will look like when he does return to the field, which keeps a cloud over this position group.

Tom Brady picked a good time to jettison from the Patriots as the Buccaneers face a much easier schedule in 2020 than do the Patriots. Tampa plays the NFL’s 11th-easiest schedule, including the eighth-easiest through the first eight weeks.
However, that schedule ease relates to win totals. Comparing what the Bucs offense faced last year to what they will face this year, the schedule gets much more difficult. Winston tossed 32 touchdowns and 30 interceptions against the NFL’s fourth-worst pass defenses. This year Brady will face the 16th-toughest pass defenses. That increase in difficulty of pass defenses faced is second-highest in the NFL. The Bucs also are playing five games with less rest than their opponent and only one with more rest. In four consecutive weeks (Weeks 6 through 9) the Bucs are at a rest disadvantage in every game. They play two straight teams with bye weeks to prepare for them and then the Giants who have three extra days of rest plus they must play on a short week against the Saints.
Tampa has a unique quirk from Week 9 onward in the season: they host three games against teams that typically play in domes (Saints, Vikings, and Falcons). Over the last 30 years, Florida teams do much better at home late in the season as compared to earlier. They win 56% and cover 49% of games from November onward, much better than they do to start the season. Additionally, from Week 9 onward, the Bucs face four teams forecast to finish the year at-or-above .500, and all four games are at home (Saints, Rams, Chiefs, and Vikings).
Brady will have to play four games in domes this year (Saints, Raiders, Falcons, and Lions). He was 17-4 (81%) both SU and ATS in domes when in New England.
On the defensive side of the ball, the 2019 Bucs were the best team against the run and that was against the NFL’s fourth-toughest schedule of run offenses. This year, that drops to 21st toughest, so the run defense should theoretically be stellar again. The key, however, is always the pass defense. Because even with a lead, opposing offenses won’t bother running, they’ll just pass. The 2019 Bucs ranked 12th against the pass, with a developing, young secondary. And this year they face the fourth-toughest schedule of pass offenses (11th-toughest in 2019).
