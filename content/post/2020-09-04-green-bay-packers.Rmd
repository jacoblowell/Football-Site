After a 7-9 record in 2017 and a 6-10 record in 2018, the Packers exploded to win 13 games in 2019. That’s an increase of seven wins over their 2018 total.
In the last 30 years, there have been 52 teams to improve by six or more wins from one year to the next.
Only 18 of those 52 teams improved to record at least 12 wins, like the Packers (13 wins .last year). Of those 18 teams:
Zero won the same number or more games the following year.
All lost at least two more games the following year.
13 lost at least four more games the following year.

On average, these18 teams lost 5.9 more games the following year.

That would put the Packers down from 13 wins in 2019 to seven wins in 2020.
If you want to expand the sample from 18 teams to 35 teams, we can say if a team had
an improvement of five or more wins (down from six in the prior example) from one year .to the next and improved to at least 12 wins total. Still, the average decrease in wins is
4.8 (down from 5.9). And that would put the Packers at 8-8 in 2020.

Teams with the same core players don’t just permanently get better overnight. A new coach can provide a slight boost, but there were a lot of factors that contributed to the massive turnaround Green Bay saw in 2019.
First, compare the 2018 Packers to the 2019 Packers:

Digging deeper, in 2018, the Packers passed on 61% of early downs when the game was within one score (fourth-most in the NFL).
In 2019, the Packers passed on just 53% of early downs when the game was within one score (15th in the NFL).
Because of the more conservative nature of both the pass rate and of the passing attack in general, the Packers faced an average of 7.6 yards to go on third downs in one-score games, ranking fourth-worst in the NFL. The NFL average was 7.1 yards to go.
Compare that to 2018, with a more aggressive early-down offensive approach. The offense faced third and an average of only 6.9 yards to go in one-score games, which ranked 14th in the NFL and just above average.
The difference was, despite having fewer yards to go (6.9) the 2018 Packers converted only 33% of these third downs, which ranked 28th in the NFL overall but was worst for any of the 24 teams to average fewer than 7.5 yards to go.
Whereas the 2019 Packers converted 41% of these third-downs, which ranked 17th in the NFL overall but was fifth-best for any of the 20 teams that averaged at least 7.2 yards to go.
Not only was the 2018 offense putting the Packers in a better position to convert when on third down than the 2019 Packers, but the 2018 Packers were also better at bypassing third downs completely.
In 2018, the Packers ranked 13th in EDSR whereas the 2019 Packers ranked 17th.
In the entirety of the 2019 season, there were only two games that saw the Packers decisively win the EDSR battle: Week 6 vs the Lions and Week 16 vs the Vikings. In both games, it was not an offensive outburst of efficiency that led to the big EDSR win. In fact, the offense produced average EDSR results and the Packers scored 23 points in each game.
The decisive wins came thanks to defensive performances. The Packers held Stafford to 18/32, a 44% success rate, and a passer rating of just 83.5. They held Cousins to 16/29, a 41% success rate, only 4.2 YPA, and a 62.7 passer rating.
27 – Philip Rivers
27 – Dak Prescott (3)
26 – Dwayne Haskins (1) 26 – David Blough (1)
19 – Jimmy Garoppolo
3 – Mike Glennon
The list is littered with backups, rookies, undrafted players, and mediocre quarterbacks. Note that only seven of the Packers’ 17 interceptions taken last year came against non-rookie QBs who will be 2020 starters. In 2020, they still will face Cousins, likely two games vs Stafford instead of one, Rivers (now with the Colts), Wentz, and Garoppolo. But there will be a lot of new names and improved QB play as a whole.
Out: Mitch Trubisky, Kyle Allen, Matt Moore, Joe Flacco, Derek Carr, Dak Prescott and rookies Dwayne Haskins, Daniel Jones, and David Blough
In: Drew Brees, Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, Deshaun Watson, Nick Foles, Ryan Tannehill, Teddy Bridgewater, and Gardner Minshew
It’s impossible to predict health, but suffice it to say the Packers pass defense is in for a tougher road in 2020.
Immediately one of the biggest first impressions we got from the 2019 Packers was the way they jumped on opponents early. Their Week 1 game aside, the Packers went from Week 2 to 15 with the following per-quarter averages:
1st quarter: 105 points 2nd quarter: 68 points 3rd quarter: 86 points 4th quarter: 62 points
In the first quarter, the Packers averaged 8.1 yds/play and a 54% success rate. The rest of the game, they averaged 6.3 yds/play and a 46% success rate.
The way the Packers jumped on teams in the first quarter came on the shoulders of two key elements: first downs from 11 personnel and tremendous second down playcalling.
The Packers used 11 personnel on first quarter first downs more than double any other grouping. They went 60% pass on such plays, which was extremely aggressive and was the third-highest rate in the NFL (average was 46% pass). These passes had a very low aDOT but a high success rate. They averaged just 4.9 air yards per attempt but recorded a 73% success rate and gained 8.4 YPA.
The key to springing these was play-action. Without play-action on such passes, Aaron Rodgers averaged just 6.6 YPA with a 57% success rate and 83 rating. But with play-action, they averaged 10.6 YPA with a 92% success rate and 139 rating.
These passes were very short (3.8 air yards). The floor on these short passes was extremely high and Matt LaFleur fooled defenses by throwing more from 11 than opponents expected (60% pass) after using play-action to draw defenders.
As effective as these plays were, what LaFleur did on second downs was equally impressive.
After throwing extremely short on first down (6.1 air yds/pass, below the 7.4 NFL avg), the Packers came back with deep passes on second down (9.2 air yds/pass, well above the 6.5 NFL avg). That aDOT ranked second-highest in the entire NFL. The Packers run game wasn’t good at all on second downs in the first quarter (43% success, 4.2 YPC) but this deep, aggressive pass game off of the conservative first down pass game stunned many opponents out the gates. Rodgers averaged 11.4 YPA, a 60% success rate, a 154 passer rating, and 6:0 TD:INT. He was the best quarterback in the NFL on this down. The Packers didn’t rely on play-action, using it on just 39% of dropbacks and were even more explosive without it.
Football is an inherently low sample size sport, so there is an amount of luck and variance sprinkled heavily about. But it’s tough to argue against what went right in close games. Great turnover differential made things easier thanks to playing a terrible slate of quarterbacks and so did great first quarter play scripting with a first-year playcaller. Without those, the 2019 Packers don’t hit double-digit wins.
This begs the question: is this year’s Packers team better than the 2019 edition?
They will have to be, specifically on offense, because their schedule is tougher. After playing the 19th-toughest schedule of opposing defenses in 2019, they will now face the forecast ninth-toughest schedule of opposing defenses in 2020. Specifically it will be more difficult by facing the fourth-toughest slate of run defenses after paying a league-average schedule in 2019. And we mentioned how the caliber of opposing quarterbacks will be significantly more challenging.
The Packers didn’t do themselves many favors with the 2020 draft in terms of taking the next step. Drafting Rodgers’s replacement plus a bruising running back and a TE/FB isn’t exactly the way you take a leap to improve the passing offense.
Keep in mind, a big part of the Packers’ passing attack was surprising defenses in the first quarter en route to ranking as the fourth-best passing attack in the first quarter. But they ranked 19th over the rest of the game. That surprise may be lessened this year. Additionally, when divisional defenses saw this offense for a second time, things were very different.
Meeting one: 6.7 YPA, 94 rating, 5:1 TD:INT. Meeting two: 5.9 YPA, 74 rating, 3:2 TD:INT.

The Packers closed 2019 17th in the league in both successful play rate through the air (44%), and in passing yards per attempt (7.0). They were able to rank seventh in EPA via their passing offense, propelled by a league-low four interceptions. Whether you want to chalk the root of the issue up to late-career fragility, supporting cast, or scheme change, Aaron Rodgers has not been the tide-lifting passer he was over the front half of his career. After averaging
7.5 yards per pass attempt in each of his first seven seasons as a starting quarterback, Rodgers has now averaged 7.1 yards per pass attempt over the past five seasons with a high of 7.4 yards. In his first season without Mike McCarthy, Rodgers threw for 7.0 yards per pass attempt, which ranked 22nd among all quarterbacks to start multiple games a year ago. The Packers declined to add any significant weapons in the passing game this offseason outside of Davante Adams and appear determined on driving their offense through the run game over Rodgers at this stage.

Green Bay was middle of the road a year ago utilizing their playmakers. The team ranked 14th in yards per target (8.2 yards) and 18th in success rate (50%) targeting their wide receivers. Anchored by Davante Adams, his 127 targets were 71 more than the next highest wide receiver on the team. The team added Devin Funchess to the room in 2020 while they lost Geronimo Allison. The Packers were 22nd in success rate targeting their tight ends. Moving on from Jimmy Graham, Green Bay will look for second-year Jace Sternberger to make a major stride after taking him in the third round a year ago. Where Green Bay was strongest was getting the ball to their backs through the air. The Packers were 11th in success rate targeting their backs.

Matt LaFleur has been vocal about his desire to run the football effectively and Green Bay did just that in 2019. They ranked seventh in the league in success rate (51%) and 10th in EPA on the ground during his first season with the Packers while ranking 15th in rushing yardage per game 112.2. With 1,084 yards and 16 touchdowns rushing on just 236 carries, Aaron Jones remained one of the most efficient runners in the league. He ranked 10th among all running backs in success rate (55%) and fourth among all backs with more than 200 carries in that area. The team added a big and athletic back in the second round in the draft in A.J. Dillon, further reinforcing the Packers’ desire to run the ball while limiting the overall rushing volume for Jones.

The Path for Davante Adams to be the top fantasy WR in 2020 is set
Some poor touchdown variance and a turf toe injury dampened the front half of the 2019 season for Davante Adams, but over the final 10 games of the 2019 season including the playoffs, Adams caught 75-of-113 targets for 917 yards and seven touchdowns. For fantasy purposes, he averaged 20.9 PPR points per game over that span. Over those 10 games, he scored fewer than 18.8 PPR points twice. With no other viable pass catchers in the Green Bay offense, Adams accounted for 33.4% of the Green Bay targets, 34.4% of the receptions, 40.5% of the receiving yards, and 50% of the receiving touchdowns while averaging 2.57 yards per team pass attempt. For the season, Michael Thomas accounted for 33.1% of the New Orleans targets, catching 35.6% of their team receptions for 38.9% of the yardage and 25% of the touchdowns through the air while averaging 2.96 yards per team pass attempt. Now, the Packers currently are sitting on nearly the same group of pass catchers they had in those games a year ago, swapping out Jimmy Graham for Jace Sternberger and adding Devin Funchess while losing Geronimo Allison. Adams is set up as an early offseason favorite to lead the NFL in targets while no player in the league has more receiving touchdowns that Adams does over the past four seasons (40).
Is Aaron Jones a trap this season?
Only Christian McCaffrey scored more PPR fantasy points than Aaron Jones did a year ago while he ranked third in points per game (19.7). Jones averaged over 5.0 yards per touch in each of his first three NFL seasons while his touch counts rose each year from 90 to 150 to 285. He has improved and received more opportunities as a receiver in each season as well, with 18, 35, and 68 targets through three seasons while his yards per catch warranted the increase, from 2.4 yards to 7.9 and 9.7. There is a lot to love about Jones the player.
But Jones still has a few things orbiting his situation and usage that could spell trouble. While his usage has gone up yearly, he still does not touch the ball like an elite back. Jones was third in fantasy points per game, but averaged 17.8 touches per game, which was 14th at the position. He handled 63.8% of the Green Bay backfield touches, which ranked 13th at his position. Jones also is surely due for touchdown regression. His 19 touchdowns on 285 touches ranked 11th for all backs with 200 or more touches in scoring rate per touch (6.7%) since 1990. Of the 10 backs ahead of him in scoring rate, all 10 scored fewer touchdowns the following season with the average loss of 10.9 touchdowns scored. Jones out-kicked his expected red zone fantasy point total by a league-leading 42.6 points. The Packers could be incentivized to use their new 247-pound back A.J. Dillon near the goal line this season while the Packers themselves should regress towards the mean of passing touchdown rate in 2020. Green Bay was 25th in the league in passing touchdown split (59.1%) on offense a year ago.
We also need to keep tabs on that receiving increase he had a year ago, as a lot of his high-ceiling moments through the air came with Davante Adams off the field. In the 12 regular season games Adams appeared in, Jones averaged 2.3 receptions on 3.5 targets (9.5% team share) for 3.9 PPR receiving points per game. In the four games Adams missed, Jones was the Packers’ leading receiver with 5.5 receptions on 6.8 targets per game (19.7%) and 17.0 receiving points per game. For context, Christian McCaffrey averaged 15.0 receiving points per game for the season.

After spending most of their focus on the defense last offseason, the Packers mostly left the unit alone this offseason. That’s not necessarily a bad thing since there’s a lot of talent on this unit.
Kenny Clark is fantastic. He was 14th among defensive tackles in pressure rate last season among 97 tackles with at least 100 pass rushes. He’s 25 and is in the final year of his rookie contract and should be in line for a huge extension. Dean Lowry and Tyler Lancaster provide fine depth next to Clark, but the hope is 2019 fifth-round pick Kingsley will get more playing time in his second year. The Packers also often kick their edge rushers inside, which lowers the need for more true interior linemen.
Last year’s free agency spending spree worked out for the Packers on the edge. Za’Darius Smith finished eighth in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate among edge rushers last season and Preston Smith was 10th. Rashan Gary played through injuries but did little to suggest he wasn’t a reach in the middle of last year’s first round. The Smiths both played 83% of the defensive snaps last season, which is a tough ask for multiple seasons.
No team played more Dime than the Packers last season at 52% of defensive plays. That leaves just one off-ball linebacker on the field for over half of plays. That was the role of Blake Martinez last season and will fall on the newly signed Christian Kirksey in 2020. Oren Burks is a high SPARQ athlete who could fill in with upside if needed.
Jaire Alexander has turned into one of the NFL’s better young corners and Chandon Sullivan ranked fourth in Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap in 2019 among 145 corners with at least 100 coverage snaps, per SIS. Sullivan played just a third of the defensive snaps last season but should have a bigger role without Tramon Williams on the field. The biggest question comes at No. 2 corner and the uneven performance from Kevin King.
Safety was another position the Packers transformed in the 2019 offseason. Adrian Amos was signed from the Bears and Darnell Savage was drafted in the first round of the draft. Both exceeded expectations on the backend of the secondary.

Aaron Rodgers attempted 49 RPOs in 2019 and these recorded a 49% success rate (-1.4 EPA), 4.1 YPA, and an 84 rating. Rodgers threw double the number of RPO attempts as in 2018 (24 attempts) but in 2018, Rodgers recorded a 63% success rate (3.1 EPA), 5.5 YPA, and a 103 rating on RPOs.
No one in the NFL threw more RPOs than Rodgers did in 2019, but of all players with at least 20 RPO attempts, Rodgers’s success rate was the worst in the NFL. Compare that to 2018 when he threw the fourth-most RPOs but recorded the second-highest RPO success for any quarterback with at least 15 attempts. Of his 49 RPOs, 27 were easy completion screen passes but completions did not often equal success. The Packers struggled to create positive plays with screen tags to outside receivers off RPOs.
As for what we can expect if predicting the Packers defensive regression in 2020, I’ll note that while they were a league-average defense in most categories and fringe top-10 in a few others, there were some glaring weaknesses that teams should be able to capitalize on. I’ll share just three of at least a dozen:
● The Packers defense did a great job in the first half defending the perimeter but was extremely vulnerable between the numbers. Wide receivers saw far better production (63% success, 11.2 YPA) attacking the Packers between the numbers compared to outside the numbers (42% success, 8.5 YPA).
● The Packers defense was the NFL’s most sensitive team to first half play-action (they gave up 22% more success and 4.5 more YPA on passes in the first half when play-action was used, both are the most in the NFL). Equally as important, the Packers did not record a single sack in the first half when play-action was used (0% sack rate vs 9.6% sack rate without play-action).
● The Packers defense ranked bottom-3 defending tight ends, regardless of whether they are aligned in the slot, in-line, or out wide (bottom-3 in every pre-snap alignment). The Packers allowed massive productivity to tight ends in the red zone (69% success, 5.8 YPA), particularly when compared to WRs (37% success, 2.6 YPA).
I predicted last May the Packers would face a league-average schedule in 2019 and they did. The story doesn’t change, as I predicted they will face the exact same 15th-easiest schedule in 2020. After losing in California by a combined 63-19 margin, the Packers won’t love facing the 49ers in San Francisco Week 9, but with the game being a short-week Thursday night game, it makes matters even worse for the Packers. West coast teams are 11-3 as home favorites on Thursday night, and are undefeated when hosting a team on Thursday not from the West coast.
Another issue for the Packers is they play three teams projected to win over 9.5 games, and all of these are on the road (at the Saints, at the Buccaneers, and at the 49ers). They have several home games against teams they shouldn’t struggle with (Jaguars and Panthers) but it’s always preferable to play tough games at home. Also intriguing is the Packers play two dome teams after Week 10 of the season, but both teams do not have to come to Lambeau.
In the last 30 years (and still strong of late), the Packers are 25-6 (81%) after week 10 of the season when hosting teams that play in domes when home. But Green Bay is just 16-13 (55%) over that same span when playing those dome teams on the road, in their dome.
