<p>I had a vision for the Seahawks. Pete Carroll brings in Bruce Buffer, the fabled UFC fight announcer. “This is the moment you’ve all been waiting for. IT’S TIME!!!!” Time for what?
Time to take the next step. Time to stop thinking that better results can be accomplished
with the same process and more luck. Time to stop treading water the past five years with
four trips to the playoffs and four postseason losses to just three wins and zero b</p>
<p>Conference Championship game appearances since the last trip to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>As important as the results are the fact that of these playoff games, only one of sevenwas at home in Seattle and never did they earn a bye week.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the back-to-back Super Bowl trips in 2013 and 2014. 100% of their
games were at home and 100% of the time they had first round byes.</p>
<p>Funny how that works. Even if the teams were better in 2013 and 2014, ask them to go
on the road for three straight weeks (with no bye week after Week 17) in order to make
the Super Bowl, or ask them to rest up at home for 14 days and then host two games in
Seattle. Which scenario most likely results in a trip to the Super Bowl?</p>
<p>I’m a firm believer in setting season-long goals, but I want to know what I need to do each
day in order to achieve those longer-term goals. You don’t just climb the mountain without
proper preparation and a detailed plan for execution. My plan:
It’s time for Seattle to make another trip to the Super Bowl. To do that, they need to lock up the single bye week in the NFC this year. Doing that also ensures home field advantage. (Just like 2013 and 2014.) To do that, they need to win every single game possible. To do that, they need to race to be up on the scoreboard at halftime. To do that, they need to entrust Russell Wilson with the ball earlier and more often than they’ve done the last five years. To do that, it’s in their hands. All they need is for Carroll, Brian Schottenheimer, and Wilson to get together, become of one mind, and listen to Bruce Buffer: IT’S TIME!!!!
2019 Passing Performance
That’s really all it comes down to, which is why it’s so frustrating for some Seattle fans longing for a return to greatness. It’s the constant feeling that it’s not exterior forces holding them back. They are doing it to themselves, wasting away years of Wilson’s prime. This is why you have him. This is why you paid him $140 million. Of course life was easier when he was on a rookie deal. As a third-rounder, he was pennies on the dollar. Seattle paid him just $2.2 million TOTAL over his first three years in the NFL, from 2012 to 2014. His excellent performance coupled with the cheap salary allowed them to stack the defense and build out the rest of the roster.
But when Seattle tore up his rookie deal and gave him an $87.5 million contract in 2015, it became more difficult. Things were still reasonable from a cap perspective, with Wilson’s cap staying under $18.5 million in the first three seasons. But in 2018, it jumped to $23.8 million. And then he earned the $140 million contract, with a 2019 cap hit of $26 million. And now, his 2020 cap hit will be $31 million.
For perspective, let’s look at 2014. Wilson’s cap hit was $817,000 and the NFL salary cap was $133 million. Wilson occupied 0.6% of the cap. But in 2020, his $31 million cap hit occupies 16% of the $198.2 million cap. It’s substantially more difficult to build a roster. The defense will inevitably be worse. The talent on offense won’t be as potent. If he is worth the money (hint: he is) the offensive philosophy CANNOT remain the same as it was in 2014. Nor 2018. Nor 2019. It must progressively put more on Wilson’s shoulders because he IS the offense.
You don’t want nor can you afford to have your $31 million quarterback complete six first half passes while he hands off the ball six times in the first half to a previously retired and washed-up running back you just signed as you fall behind 21-3 on the road in the second round of the playoffs.
But that’s exactly what happened to end the season for the Seahawks. And it’s overly simplistic to describe it in this manner, but Seattle gave Marshawn Lynch $60,000 last year and he had the same number of first half carries (for 2.3 yds/carry) as Wilson, who was paid $35 million, had completions (for 17.5 yds/comp). Seattle obviously called more than six first half passes, but the point is, Seattle must put more on Wilson’s shoulders, and they must do it Week 1 in Atlanta and continue to do it for 15 more games.
Over the last two seasons, Russell Wilson’s expected completion percentage based on tracking data has been bottom-5 in the NFL. Analyzing receiver separation from the nearest defender, where the receiver is on the field, the separation Wilson had at the time of throw from the nearest pass rusher, and more, he’s not been expected to get very much accomplished. However, his actual CPOE (Completion Percentage Over Expectation) has been top-5 in the NFL both seasons. He’s a wizard. Let him make magic.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why I wrote that the Seahawks must race to be up at halftime in my plan for the 2020 Seahawks. First, it’s far easier to win that way. Teams leading at halftime win 78% of games. But for Wilson, he’s even better than the NFL averages. Seattle is 65-7 (90%) with a halftime lead under Wilson, including 6-0 in 2019, 13-0 the last two years, and 27-2 (93%) since 2016.
But secondly, it alleviates pressure from Wilson to fight back in the second half of games to earn a win. The NFL season is a war of attrition in many ways. There are only going to be so many games a year that Russell Wilson can stay pure, healthy, and full of 100% energy in order to pull off a comeback.
Look at last season: From Weeks 1-13, the Seahawks trailed at halftime in seven games. Wilson incredibly willed them back in the second half to win six of those seven games, including two overtime wins. But to close the season, from Week 14 onward, Seattle trailed at halftime in four games and lost all four.</p>
<p>Wilson ran out of magic down the stretch. He couldn’t continue pulling the rabbit out of the hat every single week. No one could.
Even what Wilson did last year, in winning six of 11 games when down at half, was atypical for him. Look at 2015 through 2018: Seattle, when trailing at halftime, went 2-4, 0-5-1, 3-6, and 3-6 in those four seasons. They were a combined 8-21-1 (28%). It’s hard to win if down at halftime. It’s more difficult when your defense is nowhere near the level it was in 2013 and 2014 and you don’t have as talented an offense surrounding you.
To start the 2019 season, Seattle trailed in 10 of 12 games! More remarkable, they were 10-2 in those 12 games!! Considering teams lose 64% of games that opponents have a lead, to win 83% of these games over your first 12 games played is incredible.
Unfortunately, I covered this at length during the season out eventually. They need to play with more urgency earlier in games.”
From that moment onward, Seattle went 0-4 to close the season in games their opponent had a lead of any kind.
During the regular season, Seattle held a lead at the start of the second quarter in just five of 16 games and held a halftime lead in just five games. They trailed at some point in 13 of 16 games. And yet they went 11-5. I noted before their playoff loss to the Packers: “Their ability to come from behind &amp; win is absolutely not sustainable. They must find a way to get out early.” They trailed 21-3 at halftime and despite a furious second-half comeback, their season ended on the frozen tundra.
Seattle went 10-2 in one-score games last year, up from 5-6 in 2018. Again, this isn’t something that is sustainable.
Pete Carroll needs to take a hard look at these numbers and the case I’ve laid out. Seattle is not some “good luck” away from winning a Super Bowl. Seattle was lucky to go 11-5 last year.
Unfortunately, despite frequent double-digit win seasons, they aren’t as close to winning it all as Carroll would like to believe. He needs to look at my plan and realize that “getting into the tournament” isn’t getting him any closer to winning it. He must do everything he can to ensure Seattle gets that first-round bye. And the plan for years, which gets rinsed and reused thanks to false optimism of “double-digit win seasons and playoff appearances,” needs to be overhauled.
Seattle improved in some aspects in 2019 as compared to 2018 and one area was on early downs offensively. In my EDSR metric, their ability to produce successful plays and bypass third downs was illustrated in their shift from 19th in 2018 to seventh in 2019. However, Seattle’s defense declined to 29th last year. As a result, Seattle won the EDSR battle in just six of 16 games in 2019.
Russell Wilson was absolutely outstanding when passing on early downs. He was second in virtually everything, including success rate (62%), YPA (8.6), TD:INT ratio (25:3), and rating (116). His early down passes recorded the fifth-most EPA (55.5).
I had wondered how Wilson would do in 2019 without Doug Baldwin, his long-time most consistent connection. Wilson was better in every single metric save for YPA (8.8 in 2018) in 2019.</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring the passing game saw no drop-off without Baldwin, one thing Brian Schottenheimer did was increase the rate of passing. On first half early downs in 2018, Seattle ran the ball 60% of the time, the most run-heavy offense in the NFL by far (No. 2 was 55% run and the NFL average was 46% run). But on first half early downs in 2019, Seattle passed the ball on 51% of plays. That was an 11% shift from 40% pass in 2018. It was one of the largest shifts from 2018 to 2019 of any team. And the passing became more efficient: YPA, success rate, and EPA/att were up in 2019.
The problem was, it still wasn’t enough. Seattle still passed 3% below average and ranked as the 10th-most run-heavy offense in the NFL. But Russell Wilson was the second best passer on these first half early downs. Seattle made great strides in the shift, but more must be done.
Specifically, on second down. Seattle had near league-average first down pass rate (and the goal isn’t average, it’s higher-than-average), but they were the fifth-most run-heavy team on second downs. Seattle was the NFL’s best second-down passing team in the first half of games. This gets back to the discussion point earlier: when Seattle is paying Wilson $31 million, Seattle must use him like they’re paying him $31 million. If he’s the best passer on these second downs, but the team is still the fifth-most run-heavy, it’s not getting enough out of Wilson.
In addition to increasing pass rates and increasing pass efficiency, another thing Schottenheimer did was position the Seahawks so they could run into light boxes and pass against heavier boxes. On early downs in the first three quarters (thus non-obvious run or pass situations), Seattle had a 42% running back run rate against boxes with six or fewer defenders. This was the most in the NFL (average was 31%). Seattle recorded a 54% success rate on these runs. Most of these runs came when Seattle was in 11 or 10 personnel and defenses played with lighter boxes to utilize 5+ DBs.
And when Seattle was faced with 8+ man boxes on early downs in the first three quarters, they had a lower run rate than the league average. Wilson killed these defenses: he averaged 12.0 YPA, a 66% success rate, and a 149 rating with a 4:0 TD:INT ratio.
The problem with both the heavy or light boxes is that with a quarterback as good as Wilson, you still should go even more pass heavy than you might think. Against 8+ man boxes, Seattle was the 10th-most pass-heavy team. Good. But that still was 59% run. With Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs were the most pass-heavy team at only 43% run. So there is room for the Seahawks to shift more to the pass against heavy boxes.
League-wide, quarterbacks are less efficient passing against light boxes than heavier ones. But Wilson recorded 8.1 YPA, a 61% success rate, and a 113 rating with 9:1 TD:INT against them. As such, being the most run-heavy team vs light boxes would be wise if you have poor quarterback play but not necessarily when you have Russell Wilson. For comparison, the Chiefs were the 10th-most pass-heavy team (27% run) as compared to Seattle’s 42% run. Again, standard convention and best coaching practices say run more against light boxes (which Seattle did). But Wilson is such an anomaly that he must remain unlocked even against light boxes.</p>
<p>Turning 32 years old this November, Russell Wilson remains as good as ever. In 2019, he averaged 8.0 yards per pass attempt (eighth), ranked fourth in completion percentage (66.1%) over expected rate (+4.8%), and threw 31 touchdown passes to five interceptions. Wilson is the only quarterback to throw at least 30 touchdown passes in each of the last three seasons, while no other passer even has two such seasons. Despite ranking 22nd in pass attempts, Seattle was sixth in success rate (49%) and sixth in total expected points added through the air. At this stage, we are confident that Seattle is not going to run their offense through Wilson’s arm, but he is still among the league’s best and most efficient passers when the team does turn to the passing game.</p>
<p>Attached to Wilson, Seattle ranked top-10 in success rate targeting every skill position, checking in third when targeting their backs (55%), fourth to wideouts (57%), and 10th to tight ends (56%). Led by strong seasons from Tyler Lockett and D.K. Metcalf, Seattle wide receivers averaged 9.7 yards per target, which ranked third in the league. Lockett ranked second in the league behind Michael Thomas in success rate per target (64%) for all wideouts with 50-plus targets. Despite their success rate to backs and tight ends, their backfield ranked 14th in yards per attempt (6.2 yards) and their tight ends 18th (7.1 yards). Expected to operate under a similar approach in 2020, Phillip Dorsett and Greg Olsen were the only real additions this offseason.</p>
<p>If you are going to be a run-first offense, you better at least be good at running. Seattle rushed for the fourth-most yards in the league (2,200), was ninth in the league in success rate on the ground (51%), and 10th in yards per carry offensively. Led by Chris Carson’s 1,230 rushing yards, he also ranked fifth among all backs with 50-plus carries in success rate (55%) on 278 carries. Backup Rashaad Penny was third in the same category (57% success rate) on his 65 carries before suffering a torn ACL in Week 14. With Penny expected to be limited early in the season or potentially begin the season on the PUP list, Seattle added Carlos Hyde this offseason, who was 18th in success rate (51%) rushing in 2019 for Houston.</p>
<p>Players to Target: Both Tyler Lockett and D.K. Metcalf
Because Seattle does not lean into their passing game, their wide receivers do not rack up high volume stats compared to other cohorts at the position. But their own play and attachment to Russell Wilson make them valuable commodities with the unaccounted for upside that perhaps one season Seattle will be forced to throw the ball heavily.
Lockett has finished the past two seasons as the WR13 and WR16 in overall scoring and the WR23 and WR23 in PPR points per game. He averaged a career-high 5.1 receptions per game a year ago. Lockett picked up an ankle injury in Week 10 that forced him to play a season-low 71% of the snaps. Prior to that point, Lockett was the WR3 in overall fantasy scoring and had at least 51 receiving yards in each of the previous eight games with six touchdowns while accounting for 25.5% of the team’s targets. Playing through the injury, Lockett then totaled just five catches for 81 yards over the next three games after the injury on just 11 targets (12.6% of the team’s targets). He then came back and finished strong, leading the team with 41 targets (27.5%), 28 catches, and 381 yards while matching the team lead with three touchdowns over the final five games of the season for Seattle.
Rookie D.K. Metcalf caught 58-of-100 targets for 900 yards and seven touchdowns in the regular season while catching 11-of-14 targets for 219 yards and a touchdown in two postseason games for Seattle. After a typically slow rookie start, Metcalf got hot over the back end of the season. Through eight games, Metcalf averaged 2.9 receptions on 5.6 targets (18% of the team share) for 50.3 yards per game. He had four or fewer receptions in all eight of those games.
Over his final 10 games played, Metcalf averaged 4.6 receptions on 6.9 targets (21.6% of the team targets) for 71.7 yards per game with six or more receptions in six of those 10 games. Even with Lockett back up to full speed to close the season, Metcalf had already established himself and accounted for games of 6-81-1, 7-160-1, and 5-49-0 over the final three games Seattle played. For the season, Metcalf matched or bested Lockett in targets in 10-of-18 games. A 6’3”, 228-pound wideout who also runs a 4.33, Metcalf still has an enormous ceiling that has yet to be fully realized. As a rookie, he led all players with 18 end zone targets during the regular season.
Let Russ Cook
Russell Wilson has been one of just two quarterbacks to finish as a top-10 overall scorer in each of the past four seasons and Wilson has done that in all eight of his NFL seasons for overall QB scoring. This is despite the Seahawks having ranked higher than 19th in passing plays just once during his eight seasons in the league. He just keeps overcoming his environment. Despite ranking 26th in pass attempts per game (32.3), Wilson ranked fifth in passing points per attempt (.540). Wilson is the only quarterback to have at least 30 touchdown passes in each of the past three seasons and he has also started all 16 games in every year of his career. As stable of a commodity as they come at the position despite the Seattle offensive commitment to limit him, Wilson still has even more upside to showcase should we find that one season in which Seattle has to fully lean on him and their passing game.</p>
<p>During the peak of the Legion of Boom era, the Seahawks had the league’s most devastating defense. That has not been the case since Seattle moved on from those players and tried to rebuild the secondary and defensive line.
The Seahawks lost their best interior pass rusher when Quinton Jefferson left to join the Bills in free agency. He was fifth among defensive tackles in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate. Poona Ford was a disruptor against the run with five tackles for loss and Jarran Reed was fine against the run with little pass rush upside. There’s little quality depth behind those two up the middle.
Seattle brought back Bruce Irvin on the edge but that’s not enough to make up for the loss of Jadeveon Clowney, who is still a free agent. Benson Mayowa might actually be the better signing after he had a higher pressure rate than anyone on the Seahawks last year, Clowney included. The big question mark is 2019 first-round pick L.J. Collier, who couldn’t get on the field during his rookie season. Rasheem Green brings some good depth but Seattle could use another impact player on the edge.
Bobby Wagner and KJ Wright make up the best off-ball duo in the league. They’re consistently on the field, too, since the Seahawks were in base defense a league-leading 67% of the time per SIS (the next highest team was at 37%). Joining them could be 2020 first-round pick Jordyn Brooks. Brooks did not excel at coverage but had an impressive 21.5 tackles for loss in his final season at Texas Tech.
Cody Barton showed room for improvement during his limited snaps and Ben Burr-Kirven barely got on the field for defense (four snaps) but was a solid special teams contributor. Shaquem Griffin played some off-ball linebacker through his first two years but has made a bigger impact when he was allowed to rush the passer, which was mostly his role in college. He could potentially be more of an answer for the edge depth than going back to play off the ball.
Shaquill Griffin had a bounceback year as the team’s No. 1 corner after a disappointing 2018. Tre Flowers was also fine on the outside — the pair ranked 35th and 36thin Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap among 92 corners with 300 or more coverage snaps in 2019. The trade for Quinton Dunbar looked like a steal at the time, but pending legal troubles could be in play. Dunbar was 15th in AYa/CS among that same group of corners. He has the ability to play both outside and in the slot, which can add another element to the Seattle secondary.
The acquisition of Quandre Diggs at safety was the steal of the regular season. The Seattle defense turned around after the trade for Diggs with a significant improvement in coverage from the first half of the season to the second. Now not all of that magically came from Diggs, but the Seahawks had lacked competence at safety before his arrival.
Bradley McDougald played well as the starting box safety but he’ll turn 30 years old this season and is on the last year of his three-year contract. Should Seattle go with some three-safety looks, Marquise Blair earned some more playing time with flashed during limited snaps in 2019.</p>
<p>The good news is, life wasn’t easy for the 2019 Seahawks and they still were a top-10 offense. They played the second-toughest schedule of pass defenses and Russell Wilson still crushed. Even with little depth at wide receiver. They used tight end Will Dissly heavily but lost him for the season in Week 6. In his prior four games, he was 22/24, 250 yds, 10.4 YPA, and four touchdowns.
That leads to the benefits of 12 personnel, specifically for the Seahawks. I loved what Seattle did from 12 last year. Luke Willson didn’t play the first three weeks, but when Seattle had both Willson and Dissly up for three weeks (Weeks 4-6) they were tremendous from 12. And they used a ton of 12. In fact, Seattle used 12 on 29% of pass attempts over that three-week span, and check out the results through the air by grouping:
11: 8.2 YPA, 57% success, 119 rating, 7 sacks, 0.19 EPA/att (not factoring sacks) 12: 15.7 YPA, 100% success, 158.3 rating, 1 sack, 1.2 EPA/att (not factoring sacks)
Seattle’s usage of 12 was lower Weeks 1-3 without Willson and lower Weeks 8-10 after losing Dissly, but they creatively worked in more 12 (not close to the 29% at optimal health) down the stretch.
Overall, Seattle used 12 personnel on 17% of early down plays last year, up from 14% in 2018, and it was significantly more efficient. Seattle averaged nearly 2.0 more YPA from 12 and an 8% better passing success rate when passing from 12 as compared to 11. From 11, Wilson recorded an EPA of 25.0 on 255 att (.098 EPA/att). But from 12, he recorded an EPA of 17.0 on 59 att (0.29 EPA/att), thus nearly three times higher EPA.
And that was without quality at the position. The Seahawks made significant investments at the position this offseason. They added Greg Olsen in free agency and spent a fourth-rounder on Stanford’s Colby Parkinson. They’ll still return both Will Dissly and Luke Willson. Because I think Phillip Dorsett is fast but too duplicative where he’s good with where D.K. Metcalf is good, and because of the general lack of surrounding wide receiver talent and depth, I would try to operate much more out of 12 personnel if I’m Seattle.
Another offensive adjustment we need to see is even more play-action. On early downs the first three quarters in 2018, Seattle used play-action on 51% of drop backs, the highest rate in the NFL (avg = 34%). But last year it dropped to 41% (avg = 36%) which ranked eighth. Considering how much more efficient Wilson is when passing with play-action (2.1 more YPA, 30% more success, 21% higher EPA), they absolutely should be at the top of the NFL as they were in 2018.
Bottom line: more passing, more 12 personnel and more play-action. Both top running backs are returning in 2020 from season-ending injuries in 2019, and the team is far more efficient on the shoulders of Wilson. When I look at the graphic in this chapter for Seattle’s “Most Frequent Play” based on down and distance, I don’t want to see a third straight year of nothing but Chris Carson runs on first-and-short, medium, and long and second-and-short, medium, and long.
The lack of offensive line continuity is the most concerning element from an offensive personnel perspective, but the Seahawks have had bad lines in the past. Seattle signed a new center and right tackle and drafted a right guard in the third round to compete for a starting job.
Another reason Seattle should focus more on the passing game is their schedule. In 2019, they faced the second-toughest schedule of pass defenses. I forecast that to drop to 13th in 2020, the sixth-best shift in the league. Meanwhile, Seattle will face the NFL’s most difficult schedule of run defenses. The entirety of the season they play just three games against opponents ranking below 15th in run defense from 2019.
They should start their passing offense from a far better place, as four of their first six opponents ranked bottom-10 in pass defense in 2019. The Seahawks have the sixth easiest schedule of pass defenses through Week 7.
The Seahawks are also extremely fortunate in that the games after their four primetime games are all at home, which means no short week road games. After hosting the Patriots in Week 2 they play at home. After hosting the Vikings in Week 5 they have a bye. They have a mini-bye after hosting the Cardinals Week 11. After a Monday night game in Philadelphia, they come home and host the Giants in Week 13.
Seattle plays three primetime home games, and they are 18-4 (82%) in these games and 15-6-1 (71%) ATS since Russell Wilson took over, both marks ranking fourth-best in the league. Also of interest, Seattle is 30-19 (61%) against teams with a winning record including 32-16-1 (67%) ATS.
While the Seahawks are rarely out of games thanks to Wilson, and have either led or been down by less than one possession in 138 of 143 games since he came to Seattle, now is not the time to stick with old habits. Now is the time to implement the philosophical changes that are necessary to win a Super Bowl. It’s time.</p>
