<p>The Chargers’ 2019 season started with leads at halftime in all of their first four games. The Chargers blew two second-half leads, Week 2 against the Lions and Week 3 against
the Texans. They lost each game by one score and sat at 2-2.
From that point through the end of the season, this team lost the EDSR battle in just one
game through Week 17. That one game was vs the Bears. They lost the EDSR battle badly, but they won the game.</p>
<p>Although they won that game, it resulted in head coach Anthony Lynn firing offensive
coordinator Ken Whisenhunt and promoting quarterbacks coach Shane Steichen to OC.</p>
<p>At that point, the Chargers sat at 3-5 at the season’s midpoint. They held leads in three of
their five losses. They held second half leads in two of those three games.</p>
<p>It was likely Week 7 in Tennessee that firmly planted the seed in Lynn’s brain to fire
Whisenhunt. The game was tied at halftime. The Chargers dug out of an early second
half hole and had 1st and goal at the Titans’ 1-yard line, down three points, with :39 left in
the game.</p>
<p>First play: false start – penalty .
Second play: DPI in the end zone, set up another first and goal at the one
Third play: Melvin Gordon was ruled to score a rushing touchdown, but replay reviewed the score and said he didn’t break the plane, setting up 2nd and goal from the 1 with :19 left.</p>
<p>Fourth play: Melvin Gordon was ruled to be tackled for no gain, but replay reviewed the play and determined that Gordon fumbled into the end zone.
The Chargers went from 1st and goal at the 1-yard line and what should be a win or overtime, to losing the game in regulation on that ridiculous four-play sequence.
A four-play sequence involving Melvin Gordon and the run game. And it dropped the Chargers to 2-5 on the season.
The next week, the Chargers beat the Bears, but they should have lost that game. Not only did they get crushed in EDSR, as the chart for “2019 Weekly EDSR” shows, but the Bears’ Eddie Pineiro missed a 41-yard field goal with :04 left in the game, which allowed the Chargers to win by one-point.
The Chargers media was looking for a scapegoat. And the easiest, most obvious thing to pin the losses on was a lack of a run game.
And that relates to Melvin Gordon.
In hindsight, this next part is hilarious: Melvin Gordon held out to start the season because he wanted as much money as fellow running backs Todd Gurley, David Johnson, and Le’Veon Bell. Every team that signed those other three backs regretted the deals they signed. Those backs didn’t come close to meeting the level of performance acceptable to justify such a deal. And they didn’t come close. They couldn’t. They were just running backs.
• Todd Gurley averaged just 3.8 YPC last year and was cut by the Rams.
• David Johnson averaged just 3.7 YPC last year and was traded to the only league decision maker willing to take on his bloated salary, Bill O’Brien.
• Le’Veon Bell averaged 3.2 YPC last year and his new head coach said he didn’t want him nor his bloated contract. A contract that wasn’t even signed by current general manager Joe Douglas, but his predecessor Mike Maccagnan, who was fired.
Those three backs were all the top-3 RBs in 2019 cap hit. And they all were terrible.
I said at the time when Gordon was holding out that he wasn’t worth it. Not even close.
But I’ve been selling Melvin Gordon for some time. Not in fantasy football, due to his volume and red zone carries. But in real football, as a real running back, I’ve been dogging him for years.
Ever since his rookie season. Notes from my series of Football Previews, by year:
2016: “Very few first-round running backs recorded five or fewer rushing touchdowns and 3.48 or fewer YPC in their rookie year. Those that did are players who never lived up to expectations. Gordon also fumbled six times and had microfracture knee surgery this offseason.”</p>
<p>2017: “Gordon was great on third down but poor in many other situations… Looking at all first and second down carries, Gordon had 233 carries but averaged just 3.8 YPC and was successful on just 42%, ranking 28th out of 40 running backs. And consider this was against the second easiest schedule of run defenses… He is not a difference-maker as a rusher, which I’m sure the Chargers hoped to get when they traded fourth and fight round picks to move up two spots to draft Gordon 15th overall.”
2018: “Melvin Gordon has averaged fewer than four yards per carry in all three years of his career. And his 42% success rate on 538 carries the past two years ranked worst among all qualifying running backs. Last year, the Chargers ran Gordon on first down 161 times even though he was the worst first down rusher in the league. It seems like Anthony Lynn’s coaching staff views Gordon as a workhorse back, but Gordon isn’t that type of player.”</p>
<p>The fact that Gordon held out was shocking to me, given my impression of where he sits in the hierarchy of today’s running backs, coupled with where I think any back’s value truly sits.
Nevertheless, Gordon held out and Austin Ekeler took the reigns to start the 2019 campaign. Ekeler was anything but breathtaking, but he didn’t kill the Chargers in the backfield. On the ground, he recorded -0.01 EPA/att, a 50% success rate, and 4.2 YPC. Basically middle-of-the-pack results for running backs. But through the air, Ekeler averaged 0.54 EPA/att, a 64% success rate, and 10.8 YPA.
Gordon ended his holdout after the Chargers didn’t fold. Gordon’s first game was Week 5 in Denver, where he totaled 31 rushing yards on 12 carries at 2.6 YPC with -0.34 EPA/att and a 33% success rate. He was a disaster.
That Broncos game marked the first of a four-game stretch when the Chargers faced the toughest run defenses of the
season: No. 16 Denver, No. 3 Pittsburgh, No. 10 Tennessee, and No. 13 Chicago. All in consecutive weeks. That’s four-straight top-half run defenses after starting the season’s first four games playing zero top-half run defenses.
A trend arose as Gordon returned. Week after week, he progressively became worse and the Chargers lost each game by narrow margins.
His second game back, Week 6 against the Steelers, his EPA dropped from -0.24/att to -0.35/att. His YPC dropped from 2.6 to 2.3, and his success rate dropped from 33% to 13%. The Chargers lost by just seven points.
Gordon’s third game back, his EPA dropped from -0.35/att to -0.55/att. But Whisenhunt kept feeding him carries, allowing him to take 15 in total. His YPC dropped from 2.3 to 2.1. The Chargers lost by just three points, as he fumbled the ball into the end zone to end the game, turning a Chargers four-point win into a Chargers three-point loss.
It’s hard to pin all the blame on Whisenhunt. After all, while Gordon is a great runner in space with the ball, he’s proven over his NFL career he’s not a great bell-cow back, nor worthy of being drafted 15th overall — all things I was saying four years ago. Gordon’s entire situation between the holdout, the return, and the immediate RB1 workload was a disaster waiting to happen.
The lack of a run game absolutely played into the firing of Whisenhunt. And while it may sound like I’m defending Whisenhunt, I’m not intending to absolve him at all. It was a tough situation for all included. I’ve made it clear for years the issues I’ve taken with Whisenhunt and his inefficient tendencies, so I was happy to see the Chargers give Steichen a shot.
Whisenhunt ended his tenure in an inauspicious run, literally: the Chargers became the first team in the Super Bowl era to rush for under 40 yards in four consecutive games. They did that during that perfect storm of Gordon returning from his holdout along with the Chargers facing a brutal four-game stretch of run defenses.
Not only was it the first time in the Super Bowl era, but it was also just the third time since 1940 that a team’s rushing attack was impotent for four such games in a row, and the prior two times were all the way back in 1946 and 1944.
When Steichen took over, the offense became much more efficient. Thanks to the 13th best EDSR defense, along with a more productive offense, the Chargers won the EDSR battle in all eight of their games under the new offensive coordinator.
The Chargers immediately came out of the gates with 159 rushing yards against the Packers and 146 against the Raiders. It clearly helped to go from a brutal schedule of run defenses to multiple run defenses ranking bottom-10 over Steichen’s first few games as offensive coordinator.
But the only way for a team to go 8-0 in the EDSR battle yet 2-6 on the real scoreboard is to lose the turnover battle. Repeatedly. And sure enough, in the two games the Chargers won, they were even in turnover margin. Here’s a depiction of the second half of the season for the Chiefs, looking at EDSR results, turnover margin and final margin (Week 11 was a bye):
Week 9: EDSR win, net 0 turnovers = WIN
Week 10: EDSR win, -3 turnover margin = LOSS (2-pt loss) Week 12: EDSR win, -3 turnover margin = LOSS (7-pt loss) Week 13: EDSR win, -1 turnover margin = LOSS (3-pt loss) Week 14: EDSR win, net 0 turnovers = WIN
Week 15: EDSR win, -6 turnover margin = LOSS (29-pt loss) Week 16: EDSR win, net 0 turnovers = LOSS (7-pt loss) Week 17: EDSR win, -1 turnover margin = LOSS (10-pt loss)
Most of these games were close, coin flip games which saw the Chargers put themselves in great full-game position to win thanks to offensive and defensive EDSR production. But turnovers cost them, and many times it wasn’t even close.
Examining some of the efficiency improvement from the first half to the second half of the season is interesting nonetheless:
Whisenhunt ran the ball from 21 personnel on 20% of the Chargers’ first half run plays, but such runs were extremely unproductive. Steichen ran the ball the same amount from 21, but with vastly different results, as this split shows on first half runs from 21:
• Weeks 1-8: 1.8 YPC, 24% success, -0.27 EPA/att • Weeks 9-17: 5.9 YPC, 58% success, 0.11 EPA/att The Chargers passing game finished fifth in the league in success rate (49%), 11th in EPA via their passing offense and ninth in yards per pass attempt (7.8). But after 16 seasons with the team and 14 years as the starting quarterback, the team openly let Philip Rivers walk away in free agency this offseason, elevating Tyrod Taylor to interim starter while the team used the sixth overall selection in this year’s draft on Justin Herbert. The last time Taylor was a regular starting quarterback was in 2017, when his team was 24th in the league in EPA through the air and 25th in yards per pass attempt (6.5). As a prospect, Herbert ranks in the 62nd percentile in career yards per attempt (8.2), 68th percentile in completion rate (64.0%), and 91st percentile in TD/INT rate (4.1:1) for all drafted passers since 2000.</p>
<p>The Chargers passing game is stocked with talent at the top. The wide receivers, led by Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, ranked 12th in yards per target (8.4 yards) and 10th in success rate (53%). The tight ends were led by Hunter Henry and ranked ninth in yards per target (8.1 yards) and first in success rate (63%) while the running backs were first in yards per target (7.5) and fifth in success rate (51%) on the strength of Austin Ekeler’s huge season, catching 92-of-108 targets for 993 yards and eight touchdowns through the air. Henry was second among all NFL tight ends with at least 50 targets in success rate per target (66%) while Ekeler was second in success rate (56%) among running backs with 50-plus looks.</p>
<p>The Chargers were middle of the pack to below average in the run game, ranking 17th in success rate (48%), 22nd in EPA on the ground, and 23rd in yards per carry (4.0). The team let Melvin Gordon leave via free agency this offseason, while extending Austin Ekeler to a four-year contract. Despite his lowest yards per carry (3.8 YPC) since his rookie season, Gordon (50%) bested Ekeler (45%) in success rate on the ground in 2019. In six games without Gordon the past two years, Ekeler has carried 96 times for 349 yards (3.6 YPC) versus his 5.4 yards per tote when in a combo role over the past two seasons. With that in mind, the Chargers added 212-pound rookie back Joshua Kelley in the fourth round to go along with third-year back Justin Jackson who has averaged 5.5 yards per touch on 103 opportunities through two seasons Charging into Transition
By letting Philip Rivers leave via free agency, the Chargers are preparing to change their offensive identity by turning the offense over to Tyrod Taylor and inevitably Justin Herbert. The team got more athletic at the position, but be prepared for a downswing in passing efficiency and overall passing volume.
Prior to joining the Chargers as head coach in 2017, Anthony Lynn was the assistant head coach, offensive coordinator and running backs coach for the previous four seasons for the Jets and Bills. In those seasons working backward, those teams ranked 30th, 30th, 25th, and 29th in overall passing plays run during the season. Those 30th ranked seasons came attached to Taylor as the starting quarterback in Buffalo. In Taylor’s three years as the primary starting quarterback, his teams have attempted 476, 474, and 465 passes. The Chargers have ranked 10th, 26th, and 12th in passing volume the past three seasons under Lynn with Rivers, attempting 597, 512, and 583 passes.
In the offseason, the Chargers’ major acquisitions were acquiring right guard Trai Turner in a trade, while signing right tackle Bryan Bulaga, cornerback Chris Harris, defensive tackle Linval Joseph, and outside linebacker Nick Vigil in free agency. Game script ultimately drives passing volume and the Chargers just had a top-10 draft pick on their own merit, but the early signal here is to anticipate a team that is going to have a major reduction in passing output and play through their run game and defense. That transition can significantly impact the fantasy ceilings of the entire core of the offense, who all have had strong reliance predicated on their passing volume and efficiency.
Is Austin Ekeler Set up to Excel in 2020?
Since entering the league, Ekeler’s 158 receptions rank sixth among all running backs while his 1,676 receiving yards are third among backs over that span. Ekeler’s touches have gone up from 74 to 145 to 224 over his three seasons in the league. In seven career games without Melvin Gordon active, Ekeler has averaged 20.8 PPR points per game and has been a top-12 scorer four times with just one week outside of the top-24 scorers at his position.
But Ekeler’s 2019 ceiling was so amazing it will be tough to replicate. He averaged 9.2 yards per target after 7.7 through his first two seasons. He caught 85.2% of his targets after 75.0% through two seasons and had eight receiving touchdowns, the most by a running back in a season since Marshall Faulk in 2001. On top of all that, Ekeler exceeded his expected yards after the catch by a league-leading 276 yards.
The addition of Joshua Kelley (5’11, 212) adds a little more size to the backfield to take on more of the potential between the tackles runs and goal line opportunities. For his career, Ekeler has converted just 4-of-13 carries inside of the 5-yard for touchdowns. Lastly, the loss of Philip Rivers is a potential thorn Linval Joseph is a great veteran addition to the middle of this defensive line. Joseph has long been one of the most underrated interior defenders who can produce both against the run and with plus pass rush. Behind him, the Chargers will have to hope there’s an improvement from two previous draft picks. 2018 third-round pick Justin Jones was a starter but didn’t make much of an impact. 2019 first-round pick Jerry Tillery also failed to live up to the draft position after being a dominant pass rusher in college.
No team relies on its top two edge rushers to create pressure than the Chargers. When healthy both Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram play almost all of the defensive snaps, though Ingram played just 13 games in 2019. To add, no team rushed just four more than the Chargers last season (82%), per SIS. There is little behind the two on the roster. Uchenna Nwosu rushed the passer on 87.7% of his pass snaps, but his sub-10% pressure rate was well below an acceptable mark to make a difference.
The Chargers used more nickel personnel last season after they went heavy Dime in 2018. That helped with Thomas Davis on the field last season, but the 37-year-old was on just a one-year deal and reunited with Ron Rivera in Washington during the offseason. Nick Virgil was signed, but his work in Cincinnati wasn’t close to what the Kyzir White/Drue Tranquill/Denzel Perryman rotation did last season, especially in coverage. The Chargers traded back up in the first round to select Oklahoma linebacker Kenneth Murray. Murray has more athleticism than instincts at the position, but that could play better with the surrounding talent of the Chargers than it would on other teams.
Adding Chris Harris to this cornerback group isn’t really fair. Harris has said he was told he’d be kept in the slot with the Chargers, which raises questions about what the Chargers will do with Desmond King but if the Chargers go back to a high rate of Dime+ packages, they can keep both on the field. King is quite good and it makes little sense to move on from a good, young player with versatility. Since Harris’s signing, there have been trade rumors around King.
Casey Hayward is also great (12th in Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap among 58 corners with at least 400 coverage snaps. The question here comes from the other outside corner, where the Trevor Davis/Brandon Facyson duo was above average by Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap last season.
All this safety group needs is a healthy Derwin James and it will be ok. A healthy James also limits the holes in other positions like corner and linebacker, which he can play by moving seamlessly around the defense. It also helps that Rayshawn Jenkins and Nasir Adderley make a good pair of safeties on their own.</p>
<p>No team in the NFL last year ran for at least 5.8 YPC, 58% success, and 0.11 EPA/att on first half runs from 21 personnel. The Chargers, during Steichen’s tenure, were the best.
The Chargers could have used even more 21 personnel to be honest. It was the Chargers most efficient grouping to run out of in 2019, particularly under Steichen’s watch.
But in addition to runs being phenomenal, passes from 21 personnel were tremendous as well, especially compared to other groupings. From Weeks 9-17, pass efficiency in the game’s first three quarters:
• 11 (76% of att): 8.6 YPA, 56% success, -0.01 EPA/att, 91 rating • 21 (15% of att): 8.8 YPA, 59% success, 0.34 EPA/att, 123 rating • 12 (4% of att): 7.0 YPA, 50% success, 0.06 EPA/att, 73 rating
The Chargers, even under Steichen, seemed to reserve fullback Derek Watt primarily for blowout wins, such as Week 1 vs the Colts, Week 4 vs the Dolphins, and Week 14 vs the Jaguars. But the offense, particularly under Steichen, was better when sticking the fullback on the field, whether it was to show run and pass off it, or it was to actually run the ball (moreso earlier in the game than later). Watt is now in Pittsburgh but there are two undrafted free agents (240-pound Darius Bradwell and 250-pound Bobby Holly) who could play that role. The Chargers could also use Ekeler and either Justin Jackson or fourth-round pick Josh Kelley on the field together. Last season the Chargers used Ekeler and Gordon on the field at the same time on 75 plays with nearly a 50-50 pas-run split.
When the Chargers won the turnover battle, they were 2-0. When they lost it, they were 1-7. They were a net -17 in turnover margin last year, so they must do more to win the battle in 2020.
One thing that will help is fumble luck. They were 32nd last year in fumble luck. They were below average on offense (ranking 23rd), but on defense, they recovered just three of 16 fumbles. That luck should even out in 2020.
After going 6-1 in one-score games in 2018 en route to a 12-4 record, the Chargers went 2-9 on one-score games in 2019. Their offensive EDSR was about identical in 2019 to 2018, but their red zone conversion rate dropped as did their turnover margin.
The Chargers have the NFL’s worst home ATS record in the NFL for the last two years. They are 3-10-1 ATS for a 23% win rate.
What is hilarious is that unlike teams like the Bucs or Giants, who fall at second and third on the list of worst cover rates at home, the Chargers have been favored by 6 points per game on average, whereas these teams have been underdogs.
The Chargers are just 6-8 outright (43%) despite being an average favorite of 5.7 points per game. The Bucs, as an average 0.5 point underdog, have won the exact same number of games at home as the Chargers the last two years.
Of the 15 teams with the worst home W-L record (outright, not ATS) the last two years:
• 12 of the 15 have been an underdog on average
• 2 of the 15 have been favored by between 1 and 2 points on average
• 1 of the 15 has been favored by more than 2 points on average: the Chargers
And yet they have the seventh-worst overall home W-L record of any team in the NFL.
Last year I forecast the Chargers would face the eighth-easiest schedule and was almost perfect, as they played the 10th-easiest schedule. In 2020, I’m forecasting another top-10 easiest schedule. With the uncertainty of this year’s offseason, playing weak run defenses to start the season could be a big benefit. The Chargers face the easiest schedule of run defenses over the first three weeks of the season, taking on three bottom-5 run defenses from 2019 (Bengals, Chiefs, and Panthers). And two of those three teams are working with new quarterbacks as well.
After that, there are two brutal weeks with back-to-back road games against two of the best teams in the NFL: the Buccaneers and Saints. But from Week 6 onward, the Chargers play the NFL’s easiest schedule. They play five straight games against teams projected to post a losing record. The Chargers’ strong pass defense will benefit from the 2020 schedule – they play seven games against quarterbacks that will open the season as starters for the first time with their current team. Overall, there are many positive regression factors favoring the Chargers in 2020. These should result in better fumble luck, better turnover margin, better record in one-score games, hopefully better health (ranked 30th last year). Another reasonable schedule with a much easier schedule for their defense. There are questions, however. How will Tyrod Taylor look as a full-season starter, or whether Justin Herbert will get a shot at some point? How much will Trai Turner and Bryan Bulaga improve the offensive line? And how will Shane Steichen call the offense without Melvin Gordon?</p>
