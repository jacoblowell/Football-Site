Watching Drew Lock enter in Week 13 and record a win over the Chargers, followed by a win over playoff qualifying Texans on the road was extremely impressive. Seeing him go 4-1 down the stretch was likewise impressive.

But beneath the surface optimism, I found more to be concerned about than otherwise anticipated.    

As we know, schedule matters, often more than what is factored into anticipated results.
The 2019 Broncos played the fourth-easiest schedule of opposing defenses and recorded
the third-worst Early Down Success Rate (EDSR) of any offense in the NFL.

But the defenses Lock faced were notable. Lock’s wins came against defenses ranked
21st, 26th, 28th, and 31st. His loss came against defense 14th. These defenses were
equally terrible against the pass.

To see how that compared to the rest of the NFL: looking at the last five games of the
season (Lock’s starts), the Broncos played the fourth-easiest schedule of pass defenses
in the NFL.

The schedule itself should have boosted Lock’s performance. It did not.

Joe Flacco received the first eight starts for the Broncos and went 2-6. He did so against an average schedule of opposing pass defenses (15th-easiest).
Then came Brandon Allen. Allen was a sixth-round journeyman quarterback who was cut multiple times in his career since he was drafted in 2016. Allen started and won his first game against the Cleveland Browns in Week 9, right before the bye. The Browns were league-average against the pass.
But then came back-to-back games against the fifth- and seventh-best pass defenses in the NFL, and both were on the road: in Minnesota (where the Broncos blew a 20-point lead) and in Buffalo, where winds were in the 20-30 mph range with occasional gusts above that rate. Good luck performing well as a journeyman QB on the road against two playoff teams with top-7 pass defenses and Mike Zimmer and Sean McDermott scheming against you.
The Broncos lost both of those games.
That paved the way for Lock to make his first NFL start, with the team back home, playing against a bottom-half pass defense in great weather. A perfect set-up.
Three of Lock’s five games were in Denver. Denver in December can be dicey, but Lock lucked out for the most part.
The first part of the weather that can kill a quarterback is the wind. The wind speeds in Lock’s five starts? 7 mph, 0 mph (dome), 8 mph, 3 mph, and 6 mph. You can’t find a quarterback anywhere outside of Florida or California playing outdoors in four of five games late in the year who faced less wind.
Heavy rain or heavy snow would be another factor to hamper a passing attack. But there was no precipitation at all in four of five games, save for the snow game in Kansas City, which definitely impacted Lock’s abilities. Patrick Mahomes still went 27/34 for 340 yards (10.0 YPA) and 2 TDs, but Mahomes is a cyborg. Lock went 18/40 for 208 yards (5.2 YPA) and 1 interception.
The final factor which can impact a passing game is brutal cold. Not 30-degree temps, not even 25-degree temps... we’re talking anything in the 20-degree range or lower. But apart from the snow game (24 degrees), Lock’s other four starts came with temps of: 33 degrees, dome, 67 degrees, and 31 degrees. When was the last time it was 67 degrees in Denver three days before Christmas, I would like to know
The bottom line was: Lock played most of his games at home. He played most of his games against terrible pass defenses. He played most games without any wind, rain, snow, or brutally cold temperatures.
This was a perfect stage for a rookie quarterback to put on display everything he learned while he sat back watching film and learning the office the first three months of the season. And he had the good fortune of recency bias, in that all Broncos fans saw Brandon Allen play and lose in back-to-back road games in impossible situations the two games before Lock made his first start.
But while the Broncos won four of those five road games, Lock’s performance in a perfect situation was not anything to get excited over.

First, take a look at the completion percentage by depth graphs. You’ll see that on early downs especially, Lock was barely at league average through passes at a five-yard depth, but beyond five yards, his accuracy fell off precipitously. It literally was off the map bad when targeting receivers at a depth of 15+ air yards.

If we remove Lock’s dreadful Week 15 trip to Kansas City in the snow, Lock's accuracy improves slightly up to 10 yards, his accuracy improves to just below average 11-15 yards, but he is still 10% to 18% below average 16+ yards downfield.
Comparing Lock to Flacco wasn’t close. Flacco delivered a far more accurate and catchable ball at all depths. In fact, Flacco’s accuracy was at or above average in all depths save for 16-20 yards, which was 62%, falling below average by only 4%.
Looking at NextGen Stats, out of 39 qualifying QBs, Lock’s passes had the ninth-highest expected completion rate. Expected completion rate uses player tracking tags and incorporates factors such as receiver separation from the nearest defender, where the receiver is on the field, the separation the passer had at time of throw from the nearest pass rusher, and more.
While he was expected the ninth-highest rate of passes, he ranked 27th of 39 QBs in actual completion percentage over expectation, or CPOE.
Pressure also really got to Lock. He was extremely poor when under pressure. And while we typically will expect non-pressured passing performance to correlate closer year over year as compared to pressured passing performance, there are times you need your quarterback to perform when pressured, and Lock didn’t do that nearly enough in 2019.
Denver prioritized improving Lock’s surroundings this past offseason. They added center Graham Glasgow, signed running back Melvin Gordon (a move I didn’t love), and used their top two draft picks to add wide receivers Jerry Jeudy and K.J. Hamler. But left tackle Garett Bolles is a total liability and has a propensity for holding (34 holding penalties since 2017, 15 more than every other player).
But they also fired Rich Scangarello after just one year as offensive coordinator and brought in Pat Shurmur. At first, I didn’t mind some of what Scangarello was doing offensively. But like Lock, after digging deeper, I can see some of what Denver may have been thinking with the move.
Denver had the fifth-lowest early down pass rate in the first half and that contributed to the fifth-worst early down success in the first half. The Broncos used pre-snap motion and play-action at an above average rate through the game’s first three quarters, but the results were terrible. Improvement in play-action was well below league average, and the same was true for pre-snap motion.
And then there was production against different box counts with play calling that didn’t make much sense.
On early downs in the game’s first three quarters, Denver was able to use heavier personnel (12, 21, or 22) to dictate heavy box counts of 8+ defenders frequently. But they didn’t take advantage of that by adjusting to pass the ball.
On 60% of plays, the Broncos ran right into that stacked box. They gained just 3.4 YPC with a 43% success rate. But when they passed, the results were magic: 11.5 YPA, 64% success rate, 129 passer rating, and 2:0 TD:INT. Had they passed more against those loaded boxes, they would have loved the results.

In a season where the quarterback play could have used the help, the Broncos didn’t adjust enough. The story was similar with regard to light boxes.

When the Broncos were in 11 personnel on early downs in the first three quarters, defenses frequently played with a light box count. In fact, on 138 of 207 plays opposing teams had six or fewer defenders in the box. This would be an ideal time to run the ball. But Denver called pass 62% of the time. These passes gained just 6.4 YPC, recorded a 43% success rate, a 77.3 passer rating, and 3:3 TD:INT. But when they ran the ball on these light boxes, they gained 4.9 YPC with a 49% success rate. This could have been something Scangarello noticed and worked with his quarterbacks to adjust for using audibles. It doesn’t help that he had to rotate through three quarterbacks, but adjustments could have been made.
Similarly underutilized was 21 personnel in general. In the first half of games, when the Broncos used 21 personnel, they went 51% pass, which was smart and slightly above the NFL average of 50%. Denver dominated when passing from 21. They averaged 8.8 YPA, 63% success, and a 126 rating. But they chose to use 11 personnel far more frequently. And success on first half passes from 11 was disastrous: 6.4 YPA, 40% success, and an 85 rating. Over the course of the entire season, Denver threw 330 passes from 11 and averaged a 37% success rate, 5.8 YPA, and a 78 rating but threw only 84 passes from 21, when such passes averaged a 58% success rate, 7.1 YPA, and a 92 rating.
New offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur and Lock will need to determine what works for them and their new receivers, but one thing is certain: they won’t find an easy schedule like Lock found at the end of 2019. Only four teams face a more difficult leap in schedule of opposing pass defenses than the Broncos in 2020.
Last year in May, I forecast the Broncos would play one of the NFL’s five toughest schedules. It was one of the few misses I had in my annual spring predicted schedule strength for the fall. But was easily explained by the fact two Broncos’ opponents, the Colts and Jaguars, each lost their starting quarterbacks for the season and teams like the Browns and Chargers were far from what we expected each to be heading into the season. This year I again forecast the Broncos will face one of the NFL’s five toughest schedules. When so much is unknown this offseason, getting off on the right foot would be ideal. But for Denver, it looks to be easier said than done. The good news is that Denver plays a home game Week 1, where they’ve been absolutely tremendous, but the bad news is they have to travel to Pittsburgh on a short week for Week 2 and then back home to host Tom Brady’s Buccaneers the very next week. They then have a cross-country road Thursday game the very next week, putting them in a tough spot. And then they play the Patriots in New England. Normally a team might stay out East for back-to-back games in New York and New England, but because they have a longer week due to the Thursday kick, they probably will end up taking four cross-country flights for those two games. It’s a brutal start, and I haven’t even mentioned the Chiefs.
But worse than “how” the early schedule unfolds is the fact they play five straight games against top-10 run defenses to start the season, including four top-six run defenses. Last year, they played just two top-10 run defenses and zero that ranked in the top six. A lot of pressure is sure to fall on Drew Lock and the Broncos passing attack given the run game may not hit the ground running. The good news for the Broncos is how the schedule unfolds after the Week 8 bye. Although they face two likely playoff teams in the Saints and Chiefs in back-to-back games, they play six of their final nine games against teams projected to finish the season at-or-below .500.

The Broncos closed the 2019 season ranking 25th in EPA via their passing game and 23rd in yards per pass attempt (6.7 yards). Using three different starting quarterbacks over the course of the season, Denver ranked 27th in success rate passing (42%) over the eight games started by Joe Flacco, 31st over the three games started by Brandon Allen (29%), and climbed up to 20th over the final five weeks started by rookie Drew Lock (44%). Lock completed 64.1% of his passes for 6.5 yards per attempt over his starts, throwing seven touchdowns to three interceptions. With a full endorsement from the organization this offseason with no tangible backups added, Lock has been given the keys to the franchise in 2020 while he will be working with new offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur.

Denver ranked 19th in yards per attempt to their wide receivers (7.8 yards) and 28th in success rate (48%) on those targets. Second-year wideout Courtland Sutton was a bright spot, catching 72-of-112 targets for 1,112 yards and six touchdowns. After the team traded Emmanuel Sanders after Week 7, all other non-Sutton Denver wideouts combined to catch just 38 passes for 443 yards and one touchdown for the remainder of the season. Needing help, the team used their first-round draft pick (15th overall) on Jerry Jeudy and second-round pick (46th overall) on K.J. Hamler to team up with Sutton. Denver also ranked 28th in success rate targeting their tight ends (44%) and 23rd targeting their backfield (41%).

The Denver run game was not effective or generating explosive gains in 2019. The team ranked 19th in success rate (47%) rushing while ranking 30th in yards above successful play rate. The team ranked 17th in EPA on the ground while ranking 21st in yards per carry (4.1 yards). Phillip Lindsay was able to reach 1,000 yards on the ground (1,011) for the second straight season, but his rate of runs to gain more than five yards fell from 32% in 2018 to 27% in 2019 and his rate of gains of 10 or more yards fell from 16% to 10%. Royce Freeman ranked 41% in success rate rushing, which checked in at 57th in the league out of 66 qualifying backs with more than 50 carries. Looking to upgrade, the team added Melvin Gordon, whose 51% success rate was higher than each Denver back last year despite registering just 3.8 yards per carry.

Can Drew Lock elevate the Denver passing game?
The Broncos won four of the five games Lock started to close the 2019 season, but Lock himself still left a lot on the table to question. Over his five starts, he posted just 6.5 yards per pass attempt and an 89.7 rating. For fantasy purposes, his weekly scoring finishes were QB22, QB8, QB31, QB20, and QB21 despite facing the fourth-easiest schedule of pass defenses. With limited weaponry at his disposal during those starts, Denver was relying on players such as DeSean Hamilton, Tim Patrick, and Royce Freeman, who were three of the top five players in targets from Lock outside of Courtland Sutton and Noah Fant.
Both Sutton and Fant struggled for fantasy attached to Lock. Sutton was by far at his best working with Joe Flacco, catching 39-of-60 targets (65.0%) for 636 yards and three touchdowns. With Flacco under center, Sutton was the WR13 in overall scoring. After a short stint with Brandon Allen, Sutton then caught 22-of-41 targets (53.7%) for 280 yards and two touchdowns in five games with Lock under center, closing the season as the WR26, finishing as the WR38 or lower in scoring over the team’s final four games. Fant caught 10-of-14 targets for 188 yards and a score over those final five weeks, finishing the season as the TE19 over that span. This offseason the Broncos have gone all-in on finding out what Lock can do with surrounding talent. The team went offense-centric, selecting all of Jerry Jeudy, K.J. Hamler, and Lock’s former collegiate teammate Albert Okwuegbunam in the first four rounds of the NFL Draft. Those added weapons will show us what Lock truly has to offer while assisting both Sutton and Fant from being the primary focus of opposing defenses.
Is Melvin Gordon Back to RB1 Status in Denver?
After returning from a four-game holdout, Gordon lost a chunk of volume and efficiency off his 2018 production. His 75.7 yards from scrimmage per game were his fewest per game since his rookie season after posting 114.6, 98.8, and 108.9 total yards per game over the previous three seasons.
Gordon has averaged fewer than 5.0 yards per touch in four of his five seasons with fewer than 4.0 yards per carry in four of those years. Gordon is no stranger to sharing touches with another back while still holding onto solid volume. Even in sharing work with Austin Ekeler the past two seasons, Gordon has averaged 18.8 touches (12th) and 17.0 (16th) per game. Lindsay has been in the same boat, sharing work in each of his first two seasons, averaging 15.1 touches per game in 2018 (21st) and 16.2 touches per game (19th) a year ago. Gordon is the favorite for goal line work while he has been by far the better receiver out of the backfield in the NFL than Phillip Lindsay. Even with Gordon dropping to 7.0 yards per catch and 5.4 yards per target last season, he has averaged over three receptions per game in each of the past four seasons. Lindsay has not found a significant role in the receiving game at the NFL level. He even had his role reduced there during his second season, catching 18 passes for a paltry 54 yards over the final 11 games of 2019 while running 57 fewer pass routes than Royce Freeman over that span.
All in all, we know there may be a larger rushing game split here for Gordon than the one that he shared with Ekeler in Los Angeles, but he does have an edge in the passing game and scoring opportunities, which are the money touches for fantasy. Lindsay has two 1,200-yard seasons sharing work, but Gordon is going to be the lead back here and have a straight path to the receiving opportunities and the goal line work, which is what we want in fantasy.

Denver’s defense took a step back in 2019 and reshaped itself with a few veteran trades during the offseason.
The Broncos got a steal with a trade of a seventh-round pick for Jurrell Casey. Casey had a four-year low in pressure rate during the 2019 season but he’s still an impact player along the defensive line. Shelby Harris was a productive pass rusher who had a similar pressure rate to DeForest Buckner last season, per SIS. Mike Purcell is exactly what a team would look for as a nose tackle in an odd-man front as a strong run defender. Dre’Mont Jones also gives pass rush upside as a rotational defender. McTelvin Agim was also added in the third round of the draft. This is a deep interior group.
Von Miller and Bradley Chubb can be a dominant edge rush duo, though Chubb played in just four games last season. Malik Reed filled in and struggled with pass rush but had better coverage, which edge rushers do slightly more often in the Denver scheme. There’s some need behind the top two, especially since the Broncos might not be able to rely so much on Miller and Chubb going forward. 2019 fifth-round pick Justin Hollins could play a role.
The Broncos have a pretty solid off-ball linebacker group. Todd Davis was an effective presence in the middle with just a 9.3% broken tackle rate per SIS and Alexander Johnson was a surprise impact player in both coverage and against the run. Josey Jewell also was a solid tackler on his limited snaps, though he was bumped from the rotation compared to his rookie season in 2018.
A.J. Bouye was the big addition and the Broncos will hope for a bounceback since Bouye was one of the most picked on cornerbacks in the league last season. Isaac Yiadom and Davontae Harris were also among the worst corners in Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap last season. Duke Dawson produced when he was able to get on the field, but that was not often. The Broncos will miss Chris Harris, but a healthy Bryce Callahan should fill in that slot role he excelled in with Vic Fangio in Chicago. Denver could definitely use another outside corner to put across from Bouye and allow Callahan to play more often in the slot.
Justin Simmons has turned into a high-impact safety and the Broncos used the franchise tag to keep him in the secondary. Kareem Jackson also pivoted nicely to a safety role while also pitching in a bit at corner. With Simmons and Jackson, the Broncos have a strong starting pair of safeties, though there’s not a lot of experience behind them.
