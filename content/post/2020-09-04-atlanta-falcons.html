<p>The Falcons made it to the 2016 Super Bowl thanks to Kyle Shanahan’s offense. But the defense was very bad that year. Quinn’s first defensive coordinator was Richard Smith. Smith was fired after two years. Quinn effectively did it mid-way in the 2016 Super Bowl season, as he relieved Smith of playcalling prior to Week 13. But after the 2016 season, Quinn promoted secondary coach Marquand Manuel to the role of DC. Manuel, too, was fired after two years.
Heading into 2019, Quinn was a defensive head coach coming off a 7-9 season in 2018 with a defense that never came close to expectations, particularly when thinking about how Seattle’s defense looked.</p>
<p>Falcons owner Arthur Blank expressed confidence in his coach and it was decided there would be no official defensive coordinator for the 2019 season as Quinn took over those responsibilities and once again regained playcalling duties.
His goal was to keep the Cover 3 scheme consistent from Seattle and allow his defense to play “more loose and free” and emphasize a “run and hit” factor rather than trying to confuse the offense. The goal was a more physical defense.</p>
<p>To outsiders, the move appeared to be a last effort by a defensive coach to keep his job intact. Through the first half of the 2019 season, it looked like it was a move on the verge of backfiring.
Weeks 1 through 8, the Falcons defense faced the NFL’s 13th easiest schedule of pass offenses. In three of their first four games, they took on the Titans with Marcus Mariota, a Jacoby Brissett led Colts team and the Eagles in a game when every wide receiver seemed to hurt himself within five minutes of the kickoff. Philadelphia couldn’t play 11 personnel because they literally didn’t have three wide receivers available.
And yet the Falcons passing defense was abysmal.
Over the first half of the season, Atlanta’s pass defense ranked 32nd in the NFL. They allowed 8.3 YPA, a 57% success rate, a 115 passer rating, a 19:2 TD:INT ratio, and recorded only a 2.7% sack rate. In those five pass metrics, Atlanta’s defense was literally bottom-5 in every single one. The only thing loose and free was the opposing quarterback when he dropped back to pass.
And like many things in the NFL, as goes passing so goes everything.
Atlanta ranked 32nd in third down conversion percentage, 32nd in takeaways, and 32nd in red zone defense.
Eight games down. A 1-7 record. A Week 9 bye.
Time for a coaching change — but not the one some were expecting. Dan Quinn’s job was on the line, but defensive coordinator Dan Quinn was relieved of his duties so that head coach Dan Quinn could see another day.
Instead of bumping up one assistant to take over as interim defensive coordinator, the plan for the playcaller role seemed so convoluted that it surely would get messy.
Linebackers coach Jeff Ulbrich, and former wide receivers coach Raheem Morris would share playcalling duties for the defense moving forward. Ulbrich was responsible for playcalling duties on first and second down and Morris would call plays on third down and in the red zone.
The Falcons also were about to face the third-toughest schedule of pass offense after returning from the bye through Week 17.
Shifting the schedule of pass defenses from 13th easiest to third-toughest and having two new defensive playcallers (including your prior offensive passing game coordinator) didn’t seem like a brilliant plan at first.
But it worked like a charm and the Falcons passing defense dominated.
Same team. Same players. Different coaches.
From the first half to the second half of the season, Atlanta:
Decreased their passer rating allowed from 115 to 76 (by far the best improvement) Decreased their TD:INT ratio from 19:2 to 10:9 (by far the best improvement)</p>
<p>Decreased their pass success rate allowed from 57% to 49% (second-best improvement)
Increased their sack rate from 2.7% to 6.9% (second-best improvement)
Decreased their YPA allowed from 8.6 to 7.0 (fifth-best improvement)
Atlanta was bottom-5 in those pass metrics and made the best improvement in the NFL combined.
And as goes passing…
Atlanta’s third down conversion rate dropped from 53% to 38%, moving from 32nd to first and Atlanta’s red zone conversion rate dropped from 66% to 38%, moving from 32nd to fifth with the best improvement in the NFL.
Thanks in large part to defensive effort, the Falcons closed out the season 6-2 and recorded wins over two of the very best the NFL has to offer: the Saints and 49ers, and did so on the road in both wins.</p>
<p>The 2020 defense will look different from a personnel perspective. Gone are Vic Beasley Jr., Desmond Trufant, Adrian Clayborn, and De’Vondre Campbell. In are Dante Fowler Jr. and two rookies, A.J. Terrell and Marlon Davidson.
But the question is, will the defense be as good as it was in the second half of 2019? And to answer that question, I look at the numbers that got us started down the Falcons defensive rabbit hole: EDSR.
The Falcons improved tremendously on third downs, but on early downs, the Falcons turned a 50% success rate, 7.7 YPA, and 3.9 YPC over the first half of the season into 52% success, 7.3 YPA, and 4.8 YPC over the second half of the season.
In other words, the improvement on third downs greatly overshadowed their performance on early downs, and early down performance is more correlated to a true measure of a defense’s overall efficiency and is more repeatable.
On early downs, Atlanta finished the season ranked 29th overall, the same as 2018 and not really any better than in any other year under Dan Quinn.
Unfortunately for the Falcons, after facing the NFL’s seventh-toughest schedule of offenses and tenth-toughest passing offenses, I project Atlanta will face the NFL’s toughest schedule of offenses including the toughest schedule of pass offenses.
If Atlanta’s defense somehow takes what they did on third down and overlays that into early downs, they might be able to take some of the pressure off their offense. But absent that, the 2020 Falcons are going to be very much like the 2015-2019 Falcons who needed to rely on their offense to win most games.
The Falcons offense was the fifth-healthiest in 2019 and finished league-average in almost every key metric. They landed 15th in overall efficiency and 12th in EDSR. They return all five starters along the offensive line. That may not be the best thing, as Matt Ryan was pressured fifth-most of any quarterback last year.
The Falcons passed often on first down last year, recording a 58% pass rate on first downs, highest in the NFL. One those plays, they produced a 56% success rate and 8.1 YPA, both well above the NFL average. However, when they handed off to Devonta Freeman on first and long, it was a disaster. Freeman gained just 3.5 YPC and a 36% success rate. He had nearly 100 carries on first and long last year. Just 16% of drives that started with a Freeman run ended with a TD. Compare that to 24% for other running backs and 25% for any pass play.</p>
<p>And in terms of any score (factoring in FGs), Freeman was 29% vs 41% for other running back runs and 48% for passes.
Freeman has been replaced with Todd Gurley and it’s not a move that made waves like it might have in years past, and I’m certainly not excited to see how it shakes out given what we saw from Gurley last season. Atlanta used a lot of two-back sets to run the ball in 2019, using 2+ backs on 121 rushing attempts, the eighth-highest number in the NFL. The problem was, they were terrible with two backs. From 21 or 22 personnel, the Falcons recorded a 38% success rate and just 2.6 YPC, both numbers that ranked dead last of 18 teams with over 50 attempts in 2-back sets in 2019.
Adding to the problem is that Gurley has little experience running in two-back sets. So while the Falcons use the eighth-most two-back sets, the Rams literally had zero running back runs with two-backs since Sean McVay came to town in 2017. Much of Gurley’s success with the McVay Rams came from spreading the defense out with receivers and clearing out the box.
The Falcons played the fourth-toughest schedule of opponents in 2019 and went 7-9. It gets no easier in 2020, as they are projected to face the NFL’s toughest schedule. And it’s potentially even worse than it looks.
The “weakest” team on their schedule is the rebuilding Panthers. But there is a very real chance the only other three teams forecast to post losing records (Broncos, Lions, and Raiders) are definitely better than they were in 2019. Every single other opponent is projected to win at least eight games. Their two primetime games are both on the road and they also play a road Thursday night game.
They start the season with four extremely important non-division NFC games (Seahawks, Cowboys, Bears, and Packers). With the Falcons’ most likely chance of making the playoffs being the Wild Card, dropping games to other NFC Wild Card contenders would be a terrible way to start the season.
And then there’s the close to the season. After the bye, they face the Saints twice in three weeks and Tom Brady’s Buccaneers twice in two weeks, with a road game against the Chiefs mixed in for good measure. It’s by far the NFL’s toughest schedule from Week 11 onward.
I currently project them to face the third-toughest schedule of pass defenses (played the seventh-toughest last year) and the toughest schedule of pass offenses (played tenth-toughest last year). Against pass offenses that ranked league average or better in 2019, the Falcons went 2-7. They play 10 games against league average or better pass offenses from 2019, but if we forecast the Bucs pass offense improves from 18th and the Bears, without Mitch Trubisky, improves from 20th, the Falcons defense very well may play 13 games against top-half pass offenses.
With 4,466 yards (sixth in the league) in 2019, Matt Ryan has now thrown for over 4,000 yards in nine consecutive seasons. But even with all of those passing yards, Ryan did lose some efficiency a year ago, posting his lowest yards per pass attempt (7.3) in a season since 2013. Atlanta still had a positive passing game, ranked 12th in success rate per passing play (48%) in 2018, but have now gone from second to third to fifth and now 12th in that area over the past four seasons, continuing a gradual trend. Ryan had a few things working against him. He was sacked on a career-high 7.2% of his dropbacks and took a career-high 48 sacks. Also, Ryan picked up an ankle injury in Week 7 and missed a game for the first time since 2009. Atlanta traded Mohamed Sanu after seven games and all of Julio Jones (one game), Calvin Ridley (three), and Austin Hooper (three) missed full games and left other games early over the course of the final eight weeks of the season.</p>
<p>No team threw more passes to wide receivers (420) in 2019 than the Falcons, whose wide receivers ranked sixth in the league in collective success rate per target (55%). The tight ends were also strong as they ranked fifth (60%) in success rate. The one area where they struggled compared to the league was their backfield ranked 25th in success rate per target (41%) despite ranking 16th in the league in overall targets to the position. Star wideout Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley still form one the league’s best 1-2 punches, while the team added Hayden Hurst and Todd Gurley to replace the vacated roles left from the departures of Austin Hooper and Devonta Freeman while there is still no solid plan for matching the production in the role Sanu held.</p>
<p>The Atlanta run game checked in at 24th in success rate rushing as a team (45%) and 26th in yards per rushing play (3.8 yards). The Falcons backfield combined to rush for 73.2 yards per game, which ranked 29th in the league and those running backs averaged just 4.4 yards per touch, which ranked 27th. The team has swapped out Devonta Freeman for Todd Gurley as the lead back in the offense. Gurley lost 3.1 yards per catch, 1.1 yards per carry, and 1.6 yards per touch from his 2018 per play output. His 44% success rate and 3.8 yards per carry barely edged Freeman’s 42% rate and 3.6 YPC a year ago. Still only 26 years old, Gurley will look to bounce back in a new environment while the overall rushing depth here is still a concern.</p>
<p>No team has more overall vacated targets (258) and percentage of targets (39.3%) from their 2019 offense than the Falcons. We also can bet on this offense being one of the top offenses overall in terms of passing volume. In the four seasons paired with Dirk Koetter, Matt Ryan has ranked first (41.1), second (39.3), second (40.7), and sixth (38.4) in pass attempts per game.
Of course Julio Jones is still the star here, but the first player that should immediately benefit from the canyon of opportunity available is third-year wideout Calvin Ridley. Ridley has only 92 and 93 targets over his first two seasons in the league. Those 185 targets are good for 33rd among all wide receivers over that span, but Ridley has outproduced his early-career opportunity by ranking 25th in yards per target (9.1 yards), 17th in catch rate (68.6%), 22nd in overall PPR fantasy points scored, and sixth in touchdown receptions (17). In 2019 Ridley ranked eighth among all wide receivers with 50-plus targets in success rate (59%) and he averaged 17.8 PPR points per game over his six games played after Mohamed Sanu was traded, receiving 18.8% of the team targets after 15.3% of the team targets over his 23 career games prior. With so much available opportunity, Ridley should easily smash through 100-plus targets in his third season.
While Atlanta has cleared a league-leading amount of targets off the books from 2019, the types of targets left are primarily on the intermediate level and near the line of scrimmage. Despite having the most missing targets, Atlanta is 13th in vacated air yards (23.9%) from a year ago. With the crux of those coming from Austin Hooper, newly acquired Hayden Hurst is set to have his first real taste of opportunity in the NFL.
Hurst was traded from the team that ran the fewest offensive passing plays in the league in Baltimore (467) to the team that ran the most in the league in Atlanta (735) a year ago. Hurst was already set to see a major target spike in clearing his 62 career targets in his first season with Atlanta, but then the team went without adding any wide receiver depth via the draft, leaving Hurst to contend with the likes of Russell Gage and Laquon Treadwell for intermediate targets in the offense. Gage got burn to close last season after the team traded away Sanu, but averaged a measly 9.1 yards per catch and 6.0 yards per target while ranking 58th in the league in success rate (49%) at his position.
The Falcons targeted their tight ends 17.7% of the time and 9.0 times per game in 2019, while they have finished 13th or better in the league in success rate targeting their tight ends in each of the past four seasons. Hurst ranked first among all tight ends in success rate per target (67%) with 25 or more targets in 2019 and ranked 12th among all tight ends in yards per route run playing a limited role behind Mark Andrews last season as he is set up to make a TE1-level jump in usage in his third season in the league.</p>
<p>As explained earlier in the chapter, few defenses have taken more talent and done less with it than the Falcons over the past few seasons. There are quality players at each level of the field but injuries have derailed some progress and there is rarely a time when all are playing well for a significant stretch of a season.
Grady Jarrett is a star inside. He was second behind Aaron Donald in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate last season as he single-handedly gave the Falcons a pass rush. With Jarrett on the field, it doesn’t matter that there’s not much other pass rush coming from the interior. Deadrin Senat could bring some pass rush and could become a rotational player after not seeing much of the field as a rookie. Auburn’s Marlon Davidson was drafted in the second round and he brings the ability to play both on the inside and on the edge.
For the first time in a while, the Falcons have two legitimate edge rushers. After spending years trying to make Vic Beasley a thing, Atlanta went out and signed Dante Fowler to play across from Takk McKinley. Fowler has run hot and cold throughout his career but finished ninth among edge rushers in Pass Rush Win Rate last season. However, there’s little depth behind those two.
Deion Jones remains one of the best modern linebackers with coverage ability but the Falcons have struggled to put decent players next to him. Not giving snaps to De’Vondre Campbell, who was a liability in coverage, should improve the group by default. But again, there’s not a lot of quality around Jones and the Falcons aren’t a team that plays a lot of Dime (just 2% last season), so those linebackers are an important part of the defense. Fourth-round pick Mykal Walker could be a weapon after blitzing on 45% of his pass snaps at Fresno State in 2019.
Atlanta reached for Clemson cornerback A.J. Terrell in the first-round but cornerback was a desperate need for this team. Terrell and second-year corner Kendall Sheffield will likely be the opening day starters on the outside. Sheffield held up well for a rookie in 2019 — 34th in Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap among 92 corners with 300+ coverage snaps — and Falcons decision-makers have been high in praise. Isaiah Oliver did not hold up as well in his second season, his first as a 16-game starter.
Keanu Neal is great when healthy, but he’s played four games over the past two seasons and will be trying to come back from an Achilles tear. Ricardo Allen and Domontae Kazee teamed up to play a good enough deep safety — the Falcons were around league average in EPA against deep passes last year per. Still, there’s some concern about how the team feels about Neal’s recovery and whether an Allen-Kazee duo could work as a starting tandem with both more experienced as free safeties playing deep. Cal safety Jaylinn Hawkins was added to the depth chart in the fourth round of the draft.</p>
