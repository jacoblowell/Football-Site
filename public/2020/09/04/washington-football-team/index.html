<p>First-round rookie quarterbacks are as preciously delicate a commodity as the NFL has in their possession. The way in which a team handles that rookie’s first NFL experience can build them up, tear them down, or destroy them.
The Redskins had that responsibility when it came to Dwayne Haskins, who they drafted 15th overall in the 2019 NFL draft.
What happened next isn’t surprising, but nevertheless let’s examine Washington’s decision-making process.
We knew the Redskins were not going to have a great season. They were projected to finish last in the NFC East. They were projected to have a losing record. They were not even favored in any game until Week 6.
As 8.5-point road underdogs in Philadelphia Week 1, the Redskins almost won. They then narrowly lost to the Cowboys at home in Week 2 as 6.5-point underdogs. They sat at 0-4 heading into a game against the Patriots in Week 5 and, despite playing at home, the Redskins were 16.5-point underdogs. As the market tried to tell us, the game wouldn’t be close. The Redskins were shellacked 33-7.
In his prior five seasons, Jay Gruden eclipsed eight wins just once and eclipsed third place in the NFC East just once. Despite the failings year after year, Dan Snyder continuously brought him back. Despite a massive loss to the Patriots, which everyone saw coming, especially Vegas, that was the impetus to fire Gruden? It was because the team lost all their games to start the season, as predicted, including being demolished by the Patriots, as predicted? But replacing him before the season, despite clear evidence over five full seasons that he wasn’t producing a winning product, was too heavy a lift?</p>
<p>Jay Gruden was fired right after that Patriots game and right before he would have defeated the hapless Miami Dolphins. In his stead, the Redskins promoted offensive line coach Bill Callahan to interim head coach and he was credited with the win over the Dolphins.
After being fired, two days after the Redskins beat Miami, Gruden said he didn’t believe Haskins was ready to play in the NFL: “He wasn’t quite ready to step in and play in the first five games of the season, in my opinion. It will take some time for him. He only played 13 or 14 games as a college player. I think he’s very raw, but he’s very talented, and it will take some time with him. Just wasn’t ready when I was there.”
But that flies in the face of what they actually did with Haskins.
In Weeks 1 through 4, Gruden designated backup quarterback Colt McCoy as inactive each week. The only backup quarterback who was active behind starter Case Keenum was Haskins, a player Gruden didn’t believe was ready to play. Why, if Haskins wasn’t ready, would he not designate Haskins as inactive and allow the veteran McCoy to be the backup?
When you have a rookie quarterback, he’s not going to get better just with film. During the week, a lame-duck coach like Gruden is not going to give him significant practice reps. He’s going to devote all of the time and reps to his top quarterback in hopes of winning games and saving his job. And that’s what happened here. McCoy and Haskins actually split backup reps many weeks of practice. As a result, Haskins wasn’t getting any substantial work.
The target shifts when the coach is actually preparing a rookie backup quarterback to get his first action. The coach will give the rookie all the starters reps, integrate him with the 1’s as best as possible in practice, so he’s as prepared as possible to make his debut.
Fast forward to Week 4. Sitting at 0-3, in the first half against the Giants, Keenum threw one interception on his first 11 passes. Trailing 14-0, Gruden was so angry at Keenum, he benched their newly signed free agent starter. But he had no experienced quarterback to bring in because McCoy was inactive. And so, in the middle of the second quarter, Jay Gruden inserted Haskins into a game he’d be trailing 14-0, against a defense that had swarmed, harassed, sacked, and intercepted his starter (admittedly one of the only times that could have been said about the Giants defense last season).
It was ridiculous. Gruden knew Haskins wasn’t ready to play in general (see his prior quote) and knew Haskins hadn’t taken starters reps to prepare for this game because he split the backup reps with McCoy leading into the Giants game.
Mistake one was making McCoy inactive. Mistake two was pulling Keenum just to prove a point with him, like playing a game of chicken, when your next move is, unfortunately, to start what everyone hoped would be the future franchise quarterback without proper preparation.
Haskins predictably was terrible and it was entirely on Gruden.
35% 13%
4.5 4.4 40% 21%
But he didn’t learn from his mistakes. The very next week, Week 5, in what would become Gruden’s last game as coach, Gruden listed his quarterbacks as such, setting up the possibility for the exact same mistake:
Starter: McCoy Bench: Haskins Inactive: Keenum
Gruden was fired after this Week 5 loss. In came Callahan and he returned to Keenum as the starter in Week 6 against the Dolphins. The replacement coach
made the same mistakes as his predecessor.</p>
<p>In Weeks 6, 7, and 8, Callahan listed his quarterbacks as such:
Starter: Keenum Backup: Haskins Inactive: McCoy
That brings us to the Week 8 game against the Vikings. The Vikings with the fifth-best pass rush and seventh-best pass defense. The Vikings with Mike Zimmer.
Most importantly, the game against the Vikings was on the road on a Thursday night, which meant the Redskins had just two days of rest at home (Monday and Tuesday) before they had to travel to Minnesota and prepare for a short-week road game. It’s the absolute worst type of game a team could have. Player preparation for these road teams is notoriously poor to begin with. Now in this unique situation, with hardly any starters reps let alone backup reps, and facing the insanely tough Vikings defense, Callahan should have set McCoy as the backup. But he did not.</p>
<p>Once again, if Keenum went down, the only quarterback available to go in was Haskins. And sure enough, against Zimmer’s defense, Keenum went down and he went down hard. Keenum was diagnosed with a concussion that he sustained in the first half. So leading the Redskins out of the locker room, without any proper preparation, was the rookie, Dwayne Haskins.
Thrown to the wolves once more.
Haskins threw another interception, was sacked twice, and only attempted five passes in the entire second half. That was because, mercifully, the Vikings had a drive that effectively ate up almost all of the final nine minutes of the game.
But the playcalling when Haskins was in was ridiculous. Literally the Redskins final sequence: 1st and 10, run. 2nd and medium, run. 3rd and medium, predictable passing situation, on which Haskins was sacked. Why even make him active if you aren’t going to prepare him nor call plays when he’s out there to give him a chance to succeed?
But this was not on Haskins, nor the offensive coordinator. This was on Callahan for making the same dumb mistake that Gruden repeatedly made all season long.
Haskins was named the starter in Week 9, and through Week 16, the team was his. They lost to the NFL’s No. 6 defense in Buffalo the next week and the No. 10 defense of the Jets after the bye week.
But then something interesting happened. Despite the 1-9 record, despite being thrown to the wolves multiple times, despite playing two top-10 defenses in his first two starts, despite playing with an extremely untalented group of skill players, the team responded and so did Haskins.
They beat the Lions in Week 12 and the Panthers in Week 13. They lost narrowly to the Packers in Week 14, by only five points. And in his final two starts of the season, against the Eagles and Giants, Haskins delivered:
31/43 (72%), 9.2 YPA, 394 yards, 4:0 TD:INT, 56% success, and 0.39 EPA/att
The Redskins operated almost exclusively from 11 personnel these two games: 39 attempts from 11 and just four from all other groupings combined. On the season, Haskins struggled when passing from 3+ WR sets, although he improved tremendously late. What hurt him most was protections from spread sets. Prior to those final two games of the season, with 3+ WRs, Haskins was sacked on 23 of 146 dropbacks (16%). With multiple tight ends or running backs and two or fewer wide receivers, Haskins was sacked on only 1 of 19 dropbacks (5%). But in those final two games, he was sacked on just 2 of 39 dropbacks with 3+ receivers on the field, for a 5% sack rate. He showed the ability to improve his protections.
The Redskins didn’t help Haskins with the thing that helped him most, play-action. The NFL average for play-action usage on early downs in the game’s first three quarters is 36%. The Redskins as a team used it only 32% of the time, which ranked 10th-lowest in the NFL. For Haskins, they used it only 31% of the time. But his splits were noticeable:
- With P/A: 10.0 YPA, 62% success, 0.11 EPA/att, 121 rating, 2:0 TD:INT - W/O P/A: 6.0 YPA, 47% success, -0.07 EPA/att, 70 rating, 0:2 TD:INT
Haskins’s results were also noticeably better when using pre-snap motion. Fortunately, the Redskins used it at above-average rates. His splits as a starter:
- With PSM: 7.4 YPA, 49% success, -0.01 EPA/att, 98 rating, 4:1 TD:INT - W/O PSM: 6.5 YPA, 41% success, -0.15 EPA/att, 78 rating, 3:2 TD:INT
In good news, new offensive coordinator Scott Turner knows how to help quarterbacks, being a long-time quarterbacks coach in Carolina. He was heavily involved in game planning as the 2019 season evolved. His offense ranked fifth in play-action usage on early downs in the first three quarters, so that should immediately be an upgrade for Haskins. His offense also ranked sixth in pre-snap motion usage in the game’s first three quarters.
Turner’s QB room in Carolina last year experienced similar disruption as the Redskins’. Turner’s offense made productive use of both the running back and tight end in the passing game, something that cannot be said for the Redskins last year. Such targets tend not to have high ceilings, but they are reliable with solid floors for quarterbacks, and both boost confidence as well as stay ahead of the chains.
The Redskins added multiple tight ends in free agency. They added Peyton Barber at running back and drafted the extremely versatile Antonio Gibson in the third-round, a running back/wide receiver hybrid from Memphis.
They are not going to wow with their skill position players, and it will be a challenge for Turner to replicate the success he had in Year 1 with Cam Newton when working with With all of Case Keenum, Dwayne Haskins, and Colt McCoy making starts a year ago, Washington closed the season 26th in the league in successful play rate (42%), 32nd in missed yardage on successful play rate, 31st in EPA via passing offense, and 32nd in yards per passing play (5.3 yards). Washington selected Haskins with the 15th overall selection a year ago. The rookie struggled heavily, completing just 58.6% of his passes for 6.7 yards per pass attempt and the exact same touchdown rate (3.4%) as his interception rate. In hopes of making a year two jump, Haskins needs to improve his efficiency on third downs and taking sacks. On third downs, Haskins ranked 41st in completion rate (50%), 36th in first down per pass attempt rate (38.2%), and 43rd in sack rate (20.6%) out of 43 qualified passers. He took a sack on 11.8% of his dropbacks overall, which was the third-highest rate in the league. Keenum took a sack on just 5.6% of his dropbacks.</p>
<p>Given their roster and quarterback play, it is not surprising to see Washington check in at 25th in yards per attempt (7.2 yards) and 23rd in success rate (49%) on throws to their wide receivers. But there is potential here as Washington’s top three wideouts were all 2019 rookies. The team appeared to hit a home run on Terry McLaurin in the third round (76th overall). As a rookie, McLaurin caught 58-of-93 targets for 919 yards (15.8 Y/R) and seven touchdowns. Undrafted rookie Steven Sims had a 34-310-4 line in the passing game, with 20-230-4 over the final four games. The same is true for sixth-round pick Kelvin Harmon. Harmon had 22 catches for 290 yards over the final seven games after just eight receptions for 75 yards prior.</p>
<p>Washington closed 2019 ranking 27th in success rate (44%), 21st in EPA via rushing, and 14th in yards per carry (4.4 yards) on the ground. 34-year-old Adrian Peterson paced the team with 211 carries while the next highest player on the team in attempts was Derrius Guice, with 42 carries. With Guice having appeared now in just five games over the past two seasons, Washington retained Peterson, while adding Peyton Barber and J.D. McKissic via free agency this offseason and could get last year’s seventh-round pick Bryce Love back into the fold. The team also went out and drafted Antonio Gibson in the third round (66th overall), creating a crowded room competing for touches and roster spots this summer. Guice, Peterson, and Gibson are virtual locks for roster spots, with Barber, Love, and McKissic fighting to fill out the depth chart.</p>
<p>Be Aggressive on Terry McLaurin
One of the few bright spots for Washington last season was the emergence of third-round pick Terry McLaurin. McLaurin started immediately to open the season, catching five passes for 125 yards and a touchdown in his first NFL game. He picked up an early-season hamstring injury that cost him a game, but McLaurin was on fire to open the season, catching 23-of-38 passes for 408 yards and five touchdowns over his first five games of the season. Then he hit a wall, catching 19-of-34 targets for 238 yards and zero scores over his next six games as the team began transitioning to rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins. It took awhile for Haskins to show some signs of life, but over the final three games of the season for McLaurin, he caught 16-of-21 targets for 273 yards and two touchdowns from Haskins before missing Week 17 with a concussion.
All in all, McLaurin closed his season as the WR30 in PPR points per game. Averaging 22.9% of the team targets per game, that mark would have ranked 14th at the position over a full season. McLaurin still comes with quarterback concerns overall that will keep his price in check, but with one the league’s most locked-in targets shares, and a stellar rookie season in which he averaged 15.8 yards per catch, he still is potentially being undervalued.
Is there anyone else in Washington to take a shot on?
Outside of McLaurin, the Washington offense is less than desirable, but because their offense is so young outside of Adrian Peterson, and ambiguous after McLaurin, there are some cheaper fantasy options that still may have something to say at the end of the day for fantasy.
Undrafted rookie Steven Sims totaled 1,240 all-purpose yards. Sims came on late in the season as a receiver, with 20-230-4 over the final four games on 27.7% of the team’s targets. One of those games was without McLaurin active and Sims averaged just 9.1 yards per reception on the season, so the floor is low here if that touchdown success does not hold up. But all of the floors here are priced in for this offense outside of McLaurin.
Derrius Guice has rolled snake eyes in each of his first two NFL seasons, but did average 6.6 yards per touch in his limited sample when he finally got on the field for his first NFL action a year ago. Guice ran for 171 yards on his final 12 carries last season before once again losing time.
The real fantasy appeal here may just be rookie Antonio Gibson. Gibson had 1,104 yards from scrimmage this past season at Memphis… on 71 touches. He averaged 19.3 yards per catch on 38 receptions (with eight scores) and another 11.2 yards per carry on 33 rushing attempts (four scores). He also is a stellar return man who averaged 28.0 yards (and one score) on 23 kickoff returns. At 6’0”, 228 pounds, Gibson ran a 4.39 40. A do-it-all offensive weapon, Gibson could end up being a “master of none” fantasy option, but with running back positional eligibility over wide receiver eligibility, that gives him more cushion to be viable as a deeper target while Washington is starving for playmakers offensively.</p>
<p>Washington is pretty set with the interior defensive line. High draft picks were used on Da’Ron Payne and Jonathan Allen, who have turned into good players, but arguably the best of the bunch has been 2016 fifth-round pick Matt Ioannidis. Ioannidis has turned into one of the most disruptive interior defenders against the pass. He was ninth last season among interior defenders in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate and has 44 quarterback hits over the past three seasons.
Montez Sweat came on during the second half of the season as Washington’s 2019 first-round pick. They invested even more at edge and drafted Chase Young with the second overall pick. Ryan Kerrigan remains an underrated edge rusher, though he’ll turn 32 years old in August, and will now be the No. 3 option in this group.
Thomas Davis isn’t the coverage linebacker he used to be at 37 years old but was still a solid tackler with the Chargers last season. Cole Holcomb was also a tackle machine as a fifth-round rookie but was a liability in coverage. The coverage can be handled by Kevin Pierre-Louis, who was solid there with the Bears last season. Another fifth-round pick was used on Michigan’s Khaleke Hudson. Under Ron Rivera, the Panthers used nickel on 65% of their snaps last season with just two linebackers on the field.
There’s a lot of unknown at cornerback and the known isn’t that great. Fabien Moreau and Jimmy Moreland both played well on a per coverage snap basis last season, though they had the benefit of opposing offenses picking on Josh Norman so often. Of course, to replace Norman, Washington signed Ronald Darby who was the only corner to be worse than Norman by Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap among 92 corners with at least 300 coverage snaps in 2019. Former Redskin Kendall Fuller returns after getting his best play as a slot/safety hybrid through the Chiefs’ Super Bowl run last season.
At safety, Landon Collins continued being Landon Collins after his big free agent signing last season. He was stretched a bit in coverage without much help around him in the back end of the secondary. That help still really isn’t here. Washington signed Sean Davis, who only played one game last season with the Steelers due to an ankle injury. He was a solid starter as a deep safety for Pittsburgh in 2018. It wouldn’t be surprising to see Kendall Fuller continue to work as a safety to add depth here.</p>
<p>Dwayne Haskins in Year 1. That said, we know that Haskins was in a ridiculous situation last year as a rookie and we know second-year quarterbacks tend to take a nice step forward. Most don’t have the tumult of a new offensive coordinator which Haskins will have, but in his case, it’s an upgrade in system and QB friendliness, which should make for positive returns.
The Redskins play the eighth-toughest schedule in 2020 after tangling with the 10th-toughest in 2019. If there’s anything good about the Redskins’ schedule it is that it’s defined by three sections.
The first section is Week 1 to the Week 8 bye. In that span, they play four teams projected to record at least 8.5 wins and every single one of those games is home in DC (Eagles, Ravens, Rams, and Cowboys). Tough opponents, but at least the Redskins catch them at home.
After that, the second section is the bye followed by the easiest stretch of their season: home games against the Giants and Bengals, and then a trip to the Lions.
But from Week 12 onward, it is brutal. Only three teams play a more difficult schedule to close the season. It begins with a short week road game in Dallas on Thanksgiving, the first of three consecutive road games. They close the season by taking on two perirenal playoff teams (Seahawks and Eagles) along with the Panthers, new head coach Ron Rivera’s former team.
The Redskins are fortunate to be taking on three opponents on short rest road games. Week 4 they host the Ravens who are off a Monday night game against the Chiefs. Week 7 they take on the Cowboys, off a Monday night game against the Cardinals. And Week 9 they host the Giants, who are off a Monday night game against the Buccaneers.
In good news for Haskins, Washington also shifts from playing the NFL’s 13th toughest schedule of pass defenses to the sixth-easiest in 2020. They shift from facing the NFL’s 10th-toughest schedule of defenses to facing the 21st toughest schedule. In 2019 they went 3-2 against defenses ranking outside the top-20 but 0-11 against top-20 defenses. In 2020 they project to play seven games against defenses ranking outside the top-20.
The bad news for the 2020 Redskins when looking back at 2019 is they won just three games and all were by one-score, so they weren’t victims of bad luck and variance. In fact, they went 3-3 in one-score games, thus no positive regression can be anticipated in that department.
In the turnover department, the Redskins were somehow +1 on the season, so they weren’t victims of losing a lot of games due to self-inflicted turnover errors that can be cleaned up in 2020. They also ranked 15th in fumble luck and 16th in field goal luck. A true middle-of-the-road team in the luck department. And yet they won only three games. That’s bad.
What also is bad is the Redskins’ injury history. In the summer before the 2019 season, I wrote: “The last five years, no team has lost more players to injury than the Redskins. Their games lost to injury is 44% above average.” They were off of ranking dead last in games lost to injury in 2018. In 2019, somehow they were STILL abhorrent. They ranked 31st in games lost to injury in 2019.
In 2020, the Redskins fired team president Bruce Allen and head athletic trainer Larry Hess. Rivera hired Panthers head trainer Ryan Vermillion and announced renowned physical therapist Dr. Kevin Wilk would be the team’s new medical consultant. These changes could be just what the Redskins need to avoid playing replacements so often.
Also from a positive perspective, the new coaching blood being injected into the franchise will be welcomed. Ron Rivera brings a completely different command and presence than did Jay Gruden. Scott Turner will incorporate more QB-friendly things into the game for Haskins which also are +EV offensive adaptations he was not using enough last season.</p>
