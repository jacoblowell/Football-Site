<p>The Patriots had been absolutely dominant with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick since they joined forces in 2001. They’ve been virtually unbeatable at home, and especially at home
consecutive weeks to Ryan Fitzpatrick in Week 17 and Ryan Tannehill in the Wild Card
round. That two AFC East doormat quarterbacks for years were the two to end the
dynasty is spectacularly ironic.</p>
<p>It would be hard to convince anyone back on Halloween 2019 the Patriots wouldn’t get a
first-round bye and wouldn’t win a single playoff game. They were sitting at 8-0 through
Week 8, held the top seed in the AFC, and the best record in the entire NFL.</p>
<p>The defending Super Bowl champions were averaging 31.2 points per game and allowing
just 7.6. They had what journalists were eager to declare the best defense in history.</p>
<p>I was not there. I wasn’t being contrarian. I wasn’t being a hater. I was being a realist. I
was using the schedule tools from Sharp Football Stats.</p>
<p>Over the first eight weeks of the season, the Patriots defense played the easiest schedule
in the NFL and by a huge gap over the second-easiest schedule. The Patriots had faced
eight offenses, and the average rank of those eight offenses in efficiency was 27th.
They played the No. 32 Steelers, No. 31 Jets twice, No. 30 Redskins, No. 27 Dolphins, No. 23 Giants, No. 22 Bills, and No. 20 Browns in a monsoon. The Patriots defense looked good? Against that motley crew? Of course they did. This “on pace to be record-setting” defense played nothing but garbage offenses for the most part. But now they had to go up against the top offense in the NFL of the Ravens.</p>
<p>I couldn’t wait to watch what Bill Belichick had schemed up to try to stop Lamar Jackson. But more than anything, I couldn’t wait to see the world get shocked when the Patriots defense didn’t live up to the “Best of All-Time” billing that was getting laundered around. Making matters worse for the Patriots defense, the Ravens had a bye heading into that home game on Sunday night against the Patriots. And the Ravens had plenty of time to prepare to unleash everything they had been saving up when they were cake walking through most of their opponents. I called it on my weekly B/R show with Adam Lefkoe on Thursday before the game.
The ball was kicked, and the Ravens completely worked this Patriots defense. The first three opening drives for Baltimore went 77 yards, 75 yards, and 54 yards for two touchdowns and a field goal.
It was just the fifth game in the last five years that the Patriots defense has allowed at least 10 first quarter points. And the first quarter score wasn’t as bad as the actual game. It was a total domination:
First downs: Ravens 10, Patriots 1
Total Yards: Ravens 133, Patriots 4 Passing Yards: Ravens 58, Patriots -9 Yards per Play: Ravens 6.0, Patriots 0.6
To a lot of people, the Patriots’ 37-20 loss to the Ravens signaled a baton being passed in the AFC. I already believed the Ravens and Chiefs were the strongest teams in the AFC, not the Patriots, despite their 8-0 record. Prior to Week 1, the Patriots were the favorites to win the AFC, and rightfully so as the defending Super Bowl champs. You could take them at +200. Prior to the game in Baltimore, the Patriots had shifted to -250 favorites to win the AFC. That single loss dropped them to -110.
And to show just how much that loss continued to resonate, examine how the Patriots’ odds continued to drop despite more wins. They came out of the bye and beat the Eagles in Week 11. Despite sitting at 9-1, their odds to win the AFC dropped to +120. They beat the Cowboys in Week 12, but their odds dropped to +300 to win the AFC. How could this be?
The Patriots barely beat the Eagles and Cowboys. They won both games by one score and easily could have lost both. They even trailed at halftime to the Eagles. After the Dallas game, Belichick admitted the Patriots’ punt block against the Cowboys was the reason they won the game. And then there was what the Ravens did: they thrashed the Texans 41-7 in Week 11 and the Rams 45-6. The books and sharp bettors finally realized the real team that should be favored to win the AFC. So regardless of sitting at 10-1 with the No. 1 overall seed, the Patriots were no longer favorites to win the AFC.
Whether it was their back-to-back losses to the Dolphins and Titans that technically closed the book on the dynasty, the shocking manner in which they lost to the Ravens in Week 9 sent the snowball rolling down the hill and it gained momentum over No. 1 NE: 81%
No. 2 PIT, No. 3 GB, and No. 4 PHI were down at 69%, 69%, and 66% (avg = 50%)
They took every loss hard but ALWAYS got right back up and fought back. Win % off a loss:
No. 1 NE: 78%
No. 2 PIT, No. 3 SEA, No. 4 BAL were down at 65%, 63%, and 63% (avg = 46%)
They always seemed to make the best halftime adjustments, especially when losing. Win % when trailing at half:
No. 1 NE: 42%
No. 2 GB, No. 3 IND, No. 4 SEA were down at 33%, 33%, and 31% (avg = 22%)
And you could never count them out of a game. They made so many +EV decisions in the fourth quarter. Win % when trailing after the third quarter:</p>
<p>No. 1 NE: 32%
No. 2 IND, No. 3 PIT, No. 4 DAL were down at 26%, 24%, and 23% (avg = 17%)
But nothing lasts in this world. When we were babies our mom carried us, and when she grows old, we will carry her. So it was for the Patriots defense and Tom Brady. During the early 2000s, Belichick’s defense carried the Patriots. But Brady took over and carried the defense. Both models won Super Bowls. But last year, it was the defense that carried the offense.
This defense studies everything, and that won’t change without Tom Brady. As an example: the Patriots coaches teach that water-weighted balls drop faster on passes in the rain, and get their secondary to practice against it, factor it into their coverage and breaks on balls prior to playing a game where heavy rain is forecast (which was the case multiple times in 2019). In the pursuit of winning, they literally account for everything.
However, one problem the Patriots defense had was they became highly sensitive to play-action. In fact, from Week 10 onward, they were the most sensitive defense to play-action (aka most negatively affected) in quarters one through three:
Weeks 1-9
w/o PA: 4.4 YPA, 31% success w PA: 6.1 YPA, 40% success
Weeks 10-17
w/o PA: 5.7 YPA, 39% success w PA: 9.2 YPA, 67% success
While the defense didn’t look as good late in the season once they started to play better offenses, the Patriots’ own offense was in dire straits.
In terms of team health in 2019, the New England offensive line ranked 24th, their WRs ranked 27th, and running backs ranked 32nd. This team had one wide receiver other than Julian Edelman targeted 50+ times, and that was Phillip Dorsett, who was basically a one-trick pony running down the left sideline (see his heat map).
Important too were the losses to the Patriots fullbacks. No team has used more 21 personnel over the last four years than New England. And the last two years, 60% of the Patriots red zone rushes featured a fullback. James Develin was on the field for all their rushing touchdowns in the 2018 playoff run.</p>
<p>Early in the season, the Patriots lost both fullbacks, James Develin and Jakob Johnson, to season-ending IR. Look at their weekly rates of runs from 21 personnel, by week last season:
Week 1: 52%
Week 2: 37% - James Develin injured
Week 3: 0%
Week 4: 57% - Jakob Johnson becomes FB replacement Week 5: 34%
Week 6: 8% - Jakob Johnson injured
Week 7: 3%
Week 8: 0%
Week 9: 0%
Week 11: 9%
Week 12: 7%
Week 13: 0%
Week 14: 5%
Week 15: 3%
Week 16: 55% - LB Elandon Roberts used as a functional FB Week 17: 11%
WC Rd: 28%
To see how much Belichick knew he needed more 21, look no further than Week 16’s must-win game against the Bills. He had prepared linebacker Elandon Roberts for use as a fullback and broke him out in that key game. The Patriots gained 5.9 YPC from 21 personnel with a 67% success rate. After that win, the Patriots hid him in Week 17 in case they wanted to use him again in the Wild Card game.
For years, the Patriots’ true results were tied to EDSR results. Examine the 2018 season, where they went 9-0 when winning the EDSR battle and 2-5 when losing the EDSR battle. Last year, they should have lost to the Bills, Browns, Eagles, and Cowboys based on EDSR results. They won the EDSR battle in six of their first seven games against
terrible teams (lost it vs the Bills), and the rest of the season they won it just three times.</p>
<p>The Patriots struggled to consistently generate passing production in 2019, ranking 19th in successful play rate through the air (44%) and 32nd in the league in yards above success rate created. The team checked in 17th in EPA through the air and 21st in yards per pass attempt (6.7 yards). With Tom Brady leaving New England, the Patriots will have a different Week 1 starting quarterback for the first time since the 2001 season. Post-Brady, the Patriots have Cam Newton on a one-year deal with Jarrett Stidham and Brian Hoyer as depth to insure Newton’s health. Newton is coming off a season in which he played in just two games, and has had three surgeries over the past three seasons. When last on the field nearly full-time in 2018, Newton had a career-high 67.9% completion rate and his highest yards per pass attempt (7.2 Y/A) since his MVP season in 2015.</p>
<p>New England struggled to find consistent wide receiver play in 2019, ranking 31st in yards per pass attempt (6.8 yards) and 27th in success rate (48%) throwing the ball to their wideouts. The Patriots got 100 catches for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns on 153 targets from 33-year-old Julian Edelman last season but the team collectively got 119 receptions for 1,445 yards and 10 touchdowns on 214 targets from the seven other wide receivers that played offensively in 2019. No team threw fewer passes (52) to their tight ends than the Patriots did a year ago, resulting in a combined effort of 36 receptions for 418 yards and two touchdowns. Outside of Edelman and James White, the receiving production on this team is still a question mark.</p>
<p>New England ranked middle of the pack in success rate (48%) and yards above successful play on the ground, but ranked 24th in EPA via rushing and 26th in yards per carry (3.8 yards). New England has not had a 1,000-yard rusher since LeGarrette Blount in 2016. Sony Michel led the team with 247 carries for 912 yards (3.7 YPC) while the rest of the team rushed 200 times for 791 yards (3.9 YPC). Third-round rookie selection Damien Harris found the field for just five offensive snaps all season and was out-carried by first-round pick N’Keal Harry on the season, who is a wide receiver. With Michel, Harris, James White, and Rex Burkhead all returning for 2020, the Patriots will be relying on the same group of backs to outproduce their 2019 production.</p>
<p>What can we expect from the New England offense in 2020?
A year ago, the Patriots ranked 23rd in yards per offensive play (5.2 yards) but it was even worse than that outside of the opening six weeks of the season. From Weeks 7-17, New England averaged just 4.9 yards per offensive play, which was 25th in the league. That seasonal mark was the fewest yards per play the Patriots have averaged in a season since 2006.
Bringing in Cam Newton on a one-year, “prove it” deal, the Patriots should be expected to take a new offensive identity this season compared to how they have operated under Brady for two decades.
Newton just turned 31 years old last month and is coming off a Lisfranc injury that resulted in him appearing in just two games a year ago. This after two shoulder surgeries over the previous year. Newton has been banged up, but when we last saw him on the field regularly in 2018, he had the highest completion percentage of his career (67.9%) while he posted his highest yards per pass attempt (7.2 Y/A) since 2015 and passed for the most yardage per game (242.5 yards) in any season since his rookie campaign. Newton has finished as the QB13 or higher in fantasy points per game in every season outside of last year while finishing as the QB8 or higher in points per game in seven of the first eight seasons of his career.
Newton’s career-high in pass attempts for a season is 517, while he has eclipsed 500 pass attempts just twice in his career. Over his first seven seasons in the league, Newton’s Carolina teams averaged 64.0 offensive plays per game, with a 54.2% passing rate that averaged out to 555.9 passing plays per season. Since 2011, the Patriots have averaged 68.2 offensive play per game with a 58.2% passing rate and 635.5 passing plays per season. Even a year ago, the Patriots were third in the NFL in plays run while ninth in passing plays.
A healthy and running Newton is a high-end fantasy quarterback, but what about the cupboard of skill players in New England?
Julian Edelman (100-1,117-6) was still productive a year ago, but will be 34-years-old to start the season and has not caught a pass from a non-Brady passer since the 2016 season. First-round draft pick from last season, N’Keal Harry did not take the field until Week 11 and managed just 12 catches on 24 targets for 105 yards (8.8 Y/R) with two scores while active. Mohamed Sanu will turn 31 years old this August and was a colossal bust of a trade last season, catching 26 passes for 207 yards and one touchdown in eight games with the Patriots. With Edelman already locked into his position, Sanu went from playing 84% of his snaps in the slot with Atlanta to just 32% inside with New England.
At tight end, no team threw fewer passes (52) to their tight ends than the Patriots did a year ago. This season, they use two third-round picks on tight ends Devin Asiasi and Dalton Keene in this draft. Both failed to reach 800 yards receiving over their collegiate careers. The Patriots were third in the NFL in PPR fantasy points as a backfield, but only James White (who accounted for 39.4% of those points) was a top-30 fantasy scorer at his position. Through two seasons, Sony Michel has five RB1 scoring weeks in 29 regular season games with 18 weeks as an RB3 or lower and now has Newton as a potential threat to his goal line touches.</p>
<p>The Patriots got decent production out of Danny Shelton both as a pass rusher and run stopper last season, but he’s now in Detroit with Matt Patricia. Still, there’s a solid rotation remaining on the interior and the Pats will move a few of these players around, such as Deatrich Wise, who can play inside or on the end of a four-man line. Wise only had 101 pass rush snaps last season but had an impressive 17.8% pressure rate, per SIS. New England wasn’t very active in free agency but did sign Beau Allen from the Buccaneers. Lawrence Guy and Adam Butler were both plus contributors last season on a good run-stopping line.
Bill Belichick has rarely paid a premium for pass rushers and the ability to scheme pressure will be put to the test in 2020. Both Kyle Van Noy and Jamie Collins are gone and while neither served as a pure EDGE, they ranked first and fourth in pressure rate on the team in 2019. Stepping into that role will be second-round pick Josh Uche from Michigan. Uche is a highly athletic defender who led this draft class in pressure rate (25%) but rushed the passer on just 71% of his pass snaps. Chase Winovich impressed as a second-round pick last season and will likely serve as New England’s top full-time pass rusher.
The Patriots weren’t a great quick-strike pass rush last season as they relied more on coverage sacks. They ranked just 22nd in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate.
Another place where the loss of Van Noy and Collins will be felt will be at off-ball linebacker, though New England’s off-ball position also could be considered an on-ball position. Even Dont’a Hightower rushed the passer on nearly 60% of his pass snaps in 2019. The Patriots also used dime personnel at the fourth-highest rate in the league last season (41% of plays per SIS), which limits the amount multiple linebackers will have to be on the field. Alabama’s Anfernee Jennings was selected in the third round and was also an athletic high-pressure (17%), low-rush (79%) type of linebacker in college.
Stephon Gilmore made his case as the best cornerback in the NFL during the 2019 season. JC Jackson and Jonathan Jones were also among the best statistically and Jason McCourty was a good No. 2 on the outside. This was one of the strongest position groups in the NFL and the key will be how much regression comes from the play of Jackson and Jones after no significant players were added during the offseason.
With Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung, the Patriots are set at safety for 2020. McCourty was re-signed to a two-year deal after it looked like he might leave in free agency. Still, McCourty will be 33 years old this season and is closer to the end of his Patriots tenure than the beginning. Adrian Phillips was signed to an affordable two-year contract and just turned 28 years old in March. New England also drafted Kyle Duggar in the second round and could use him in more three-safety looks.</p>
<p>The good news for the Brady-less 2020 Patriots is their offensive line returns all starters (they get prior starting center David Andrews back) and the productive run game should still be solid. They lose James Develin but return Jakob Johnson or could pivot to Danny Vitale. One of the biggest negatives, apart from Brady’s ability to get into the best play, is the loss of offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia.
From a passing perspective, the Patriots were very proficient early in the year passing from 11 and even 10 personnel, back when Josh Gordon was healthy and they played bad teams. But later in the season, their primary success through the air came when passing from 21 or 12 personnel. And some of that success certainly came as a result of Brady giving the appearance of run but checking to pass.
But the biggest news of the last month is Cam Newton to the Patriots. And boy am I excited to see this play out. When I saw the Patriots’ draft, I said in April “this draft looks VERY Cam-friendly”. The Patriots, with one of the best defenses in the NFL, started with two defenders in the second round and another in the third, before adding two tight ends in the third as well. Then they took a kicker in the fifth and offensive line help with three of their final four picks. I went back and re-wrote this chapter after seeing Newton land in New England. And I need to address one glaring issue that people seem hung up on: “who’s he going to throw the ball to” because “if Tom Brady couldn’t get anything out of this offense what could Cam possibly get?”
There is a huge difference between Brady and Newton in the way defenses can play them. Across the NFL, defenses typically play 58% of snaps with five defensive backs (nickel), 28% of snaps with four or fewer defensive backs (base), and 14% of snaps with six or more defensive backs (dime). Over the last two years against the Patriots, defenses have played almost 18% of snaps with six or more defensive backs. But the last time Newton was healthy (2018), defenses played dime against the Panthers on only 5% of snaps. Even when Carolina used 11 personnel, which typically is defended with dime on 19% of snaps, the Panthers saw dime only 7% with Newton. Because of the added threat Newton brings as a runner, and especially considering his size, defenses have tended to keep heavier personnel out on the field. (Note that in 2019, without Newton, defenses went back defending Carolina using 6+ DBs on 17% of 11 personnel snaps.) This is something Brady never had the luxury of facing.
Another thing that’s different as a result is more men in the box, and productivity when running against it. Over the last two years on early downs in the first half, looking at run plays, the only time the Patriots were efficient was when they got defenses to play with six or fewer men in the box. Then they gained 5.7 YPC (fourth) and earned positive EPA (0.15 EPA/att). But against seven-man boxes they gained just 2.5 YPC with negative EPA. And forget about it with 8+ man boxes, where they gained just 2.1 YPC and more negative EPA. However, the Panthers with Newton could do anything they wanted, and were productive against all types of boxes. They averaged 6.0 YPC against six-or-fewer men in the box, even better than the Patriots. But the real shift is when defenses played with higher box counts:
- 7: 6.7 YPC (first), 54% positive play rate (third), and 0.18 EPA/att (first, NE was negative)
- 8+: 3.8 YPC (13th), 47% positive play rate (10th), and 0.10 EPA/att (fourth, NE was negative)
While Brady’s Patriots were unable to run against standard or loaded boxes, Cam’s Panthers excelled. And without Newton in 2019, they could not accomplish anything. The Panthers rushing against 7 or 8+ man boxes in 2019 looked similar to the Patriots. Add in Cam – runs against standard or loaded boxes produce positive EPA. Try that without Cam, and good luck.
The Patriots would be wise to use more play-action to help Newton. The Patriots always have seen tremendous boost from play-action, but last year they used it the sixth-least often on early downs in the first three quarters. They saw YPA improve from 6.0 to 8.4 with play-action, and success rate jumped 10 percentage points. Frankly, without healthy fullbacks last year, the Patriots should have increased their play-action rate in 2019, but they used it even less frequently last year (29%) as they did in 2018 (35%).
The Patriots have always been a great screen team, and target upside receiving backs frequently. Between adding more play-action and utilizing running backs as receivers, especially on screens, this offense could be friendly to Newton, who had a lot of success throwing to Christian McCaffrey.
The Patriots also were second in the NFL in usage rate of pre-snap motion. Using pre-snap motion helps to identify defensive coverages and weak spots prior to the snap. If it helped Tom Brady, and it did as his numbers bear out, it absolutely will help Newton.
Having absolutely zero to do with Tom Brady’s departure, and just sheer coincidence in scheduling, for the first time in several years the Patriots are not projected to play one of the easiest schedules in the NFL.
Last summer, I forecast the Patriots to face the easiest schedule and they did, in fact, play the easiest schedule. This year my projection is they will face the NFL’s second-toughest jump from 2019 to 2020 in schedule difficulty, as the Patriots face the NFL’s ninth-toughest overall schedule.
The Patriots still play in the AFC East which means four games against the Dolphins and Jets, but each are better than they were last year. They also face brutal non-division opponents including the Chiefs, Ravens, 49ers, and Seahawks. They must make a trip to the Pacific Northwest to battle Seattle in primetime Week 2. In fact, the Patriots play twice on the West Coast in primetime, but their Thursday night tilt against the Rams is after they already stayed out West for the prior game, so the circadian rhythm impact should not be as evident. Looking at their four toughest games of the season, the only one served to the Patriots in a fortuitous spot is the 49ers, which comes after a Patriots bye, and the 49ers are off of a Sunday night game then must travel East. Otherwise, they have Seattle and Kansas City both on the road and their massive tilt against the Ravens comes on a short week due to a road Monday night game the week prior.</p>
