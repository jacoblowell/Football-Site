<p>The Saints entered the Week 9 bye with all the momentum. After Drew Brees went down with an injury in Week 2, Teddy Bridgewater started Week 3’s game in Seattle and
pulled out a win. It would be his first of five straight wins. Most thought Brees would return after the bye week, but he came back two weeks ahead of schedule, in a Week 8 home
start against the Cardinals. The Saints won and improved to 7-1 heading into the bye with
the 1-7 Falcons on deck.
From 2002-2011, teams off of a bye went 55% straight up and 56% against the spread, .including 77% SU and 65% ATS if favored off the bye. But the new 2011 CBA limited
access to players during the bye week and work players were allowed to do.
To say the 2011 CBA had a significant impact as it came to bye weeks would be
understating it.
Since 2012, teams off a bye are only 50% SU and 50% ATS. If favored off a bye, they are
67% SU but only 51% ATS.
These teams went from being 65% ATS covering machines down to -EV propositions at
51% ATS.
Favorites of over nine points have covered only 30% ATS since 2012, after covering 63% of such inflated spreads between 2002 and 2011.
And that was the fate of the Saints, as they were blown out by the 1-7 Falcons by 17 points in New Orleans despite the Saints being favored by 13 points at home. We later found out that Dan Quinn fired himself as defensive playcaller and implemented a DC-by-committee with a brand new game plan, which resulted in holding the Saints to a season-low 9 points. It was just a small blip for New Orleans, though.</p>
<p>The Saints offense averaged 37 points per game for the rest of the season.
How did the 2019 Saints repeat a 13-3 record? A few key factors. It starts with offensive consistency, but we would be remiss to not touch on the one thing that improved the most from 2018: the early down defense. They went 13-3 in 2018 thanks to their offense, because defensively, they ranked 31st in EDSR. They improved to fourth-best in 2019, a massive leap.
Offensively, Drew Brees was a freak on first down, as per usual. No quarterback accumulated as much EPA on first down passes (54.7). His success rate was best in the NFL (66%), as were his TD:INT rate, passer rating (126), and sack rate. His positive play rate was second-best in the NFL. The Saints were outstanding through the air despite not really having much beyond Michael Thomas (although new tight end Jared Cook made an impactful difference).
But where they weren’t outstanding is from a player you may be surprised to read, and that is their RB1, Alvin Kamara. Two of the most valuable places to target running backs are through positive air yards and in the red zone.
After bursting onto the scene as a rookie and having a stellar sophomore season, there are some caution flags to raise for Kamara. And they come in both his receiving production as well as in the red zone. Sometimes fans go with an easy argument, that a player isn’t as efficient or productive because he’s “being used more”. In some cases, that is a factor. But not in this one. First, the receiving game.
Alvin Kamara isn’t declining in receiving production because he’s being used more and thus, less efficient or more tired, etc. In fact, he’s somehow caught exactly 81 receptions in each of his three years in New Orleans. But his yards per reception has declined tremendously, from 10.2 his rookie year to 8.8 in 2018 to 6.6 in 2019.
Among running backs with over 20 receptions, Kamara’s yards/reception ranking shifted from eighth in 2017 to 14th in 2018 to 38th (of 45) in 2019.
Part of this has to do with where he’s been targeted on the field. In 2017, Kamara had an impressive aDOT for a running back at 1.3 yards. In 2018, that dropped to 0.57 yards. Last year, it dropped to behind the line of scrimmage on average at -0.35 yards.
With Kamara catching the exact same number of receptions each year, we can also compare his yards after catch (YAC), yards after first contact (YAFC), broken tackles (BT), and first downs:
2017: 698 YAC, 317 YAFC, 32 BT, 38 first downs 2018: 647 YAC, 198 YAFC, 5 BT, 31 first downs 2019: 570 YAC, 176 YAFC, 10 BT, 28 first downs
As a receiver, Kamara’s EPA and success rates have decreased as well:</p>
<p>2017: 36.2 EPA, 54% success 2018: 23.1 EPA, 53% success 2019: 1.7 EPA, 49% success
Kamara’s usage rate on early downs has been nearly identical. His usage rate from 11 personnel has been nearly identical. But his production from 11 personnel (by far his most targeted grouping) has declined substantially. From 11 personnel:
2017: 59 att, 7.9 YPA, 128 rating, 0.29 EPA/att 2018: 72 att, 7.7 YPA, 112 rating, 0.30 EPA/att 2019: 72 att, 5.9 YPA, 96 rating, 0.09 EPA/att
He is averaging nearly two fewer YPA and his EPA/att has declined a massive 70% compared to both 2018 and 2017.</p>
<p>The Saints also stopped using Kamara as much in the red zone. He was worked into the offense as a rookie, dominated touches in year two, but saw a ton of those touches dispersed elsewhere in 2019. Kamara’s rushes inside the 10-yard line (along with those given to the other running back on the roster):
2017 Kamara: 13 att, 62% success, 0.42 EPA/att 2017 Ingram: 19 att, 58% success, 0.13 EPA/att
2018 Kamara: 34 att, 59% success, 0.17 EPA/att 2018 Ingram: 19 att, 42% success, -0.20 EPA/att
2019 Kamara: 14 att, 50% success, 0.08 EPA/att 2019 Murray: 14 att, 64% success, 0.26 EPA/att
Kamara’s best production came as a rookie, but his
success and EPA have precipitously declined, with the
latter shifting from 0.42 EPA/att to 0.17 to 0.06 the last two
years. Kamara’s ownership of the backfield when in
scoring range was likewise concerning, as he went from receiving 34 attempts in 2018 to just 14 in 2019.</p>
<p>Expanding briefly to look everywhere on the field, we can see that Kamara wasn’t nearly as productive in his two strongest personnel groupings in 2019.
2018 rushes from 11: 4.5 YPC, 60% success, 0.16 EPA/att 2019 rushes from 11: 4.3 YPC, 45% success, -0.13 EPA/att
2018 rushes from 21: 7.1 YPC, 55% success, 0.18 EPA/att 2019 rushes from 21: 3.8 YPC, 47% success, -0.19 EPA/att
Kamara shifted from being a valuable asset on these runs to being a liability, and he was outproduced in YPC, success rate, and EPA in both run types by Latavius Murray.
I’m not sure if 2020 won’t mark a further decline in the usage of Alvin Kamara. In the receiving game, the Saints finally have a competent WR2 to stage opposite Michael Thomas now that Emmanuel Sanders signed in free agency. They still have Jared Cook, who was quite productive in his first year with the Saints. On the ground, they still have Murray in his second year in New Orleans. And they also have Jameis Winston, who is a more adept passer than was Teddy Bridgewater as a backup for Drew Brees. I would imagine this could open the door to more creativity from x-factor Taysom Hill. As such, Kamara’s usage in the air and ground may not be as strong as some fantasy players may hope.
I wanted to spend time on Kamara because no one else is calling out the decline in all facets of the game in 2019 and it’s something to keep an eye on in 2020.
The addition of Sanders could be significant. Michael Thomas is a complete freak and he and Brees play with the football on a rope. It’s literally the game tin can telephone, where each guy has a can and a string runs between both. The connection is strong and rarely missed. But it’s been a while since Brees had a respectable No. 2.
Looking at the Saints’ No. 2 WR and TE the last several years:
2019: Ted Ginn and Jared Cook
2018: Ted Ginn and Ben Watson
2017: Ted Ginn and Coby Fleener 2016: Brandin Cooks and Coby Fleener 2015: Willie Snead and Ben Watson
None of these duos would concern any defense. Jared Cook in 2019 was by far the best tight end of any of them, with his nine touchdowns and 10.9 YPA dwarfing the rest of the tight end seasons. That was only in year one with Brees and Payton. Cook has the potential to record another great year with how frequently the Saints mix groupings up. Couple him with Sanders, a player whose addition to the 49ers really helped propel the team to the heights they reached last year. I’ve long believed Sanders to be an underrated receiver. He should fit in perfectly. He will love the pairing of a great playcaller and designer with a great quarterback, and the ability to play opposite a stud like Thomas.
Sanders’s 2019 offensive coordinator Rich Scangarello said of him: “I can’t describe the things that he’s done — as a receiver that’s been in the league this long — for the benefit of this team, stuff that just you wouldn’t see on film that you wouldn’t get out of a lot of receivers in his position. And he has laid it on the line.” He’s been an asset in run blocking historically.
One note on the Saints performance in New Orleans: since 2014, while the Saints are 32-22 overall at home, they are just 22-30 ATS. There hasn’t been a single season where the Saints produced a winning ATS record at home over the course of a season, falling below .500 each year. While they have done better SU when favored (27-18), they are a dreadful 16-29 ATS (36% ATS). Only four teams have a worse record ATS as home favorites in that span (Bucs, 49ers, Dolphins, and Chargers).
This is more of a factor now that the Saints may not have the home field edge their crowd typically offers if we can’t clear games to be played with fans in the stands in 2020.
Years ago, the narrative with the Saints was they would cover all the time at home but were terrible on the road. It went that their team was built to excel at home but not on grass, and that Brees would get too impacted by weather conditions including wind.
However, over that same time span (since 2014), the Saints are by far the NFL’s best team on the road. They have covered 31 of 48 road games (66%), best in the NFL. So the stigma of the Saints has flip-flopped, and if too much home-field edge is baked into the Saints’ spreads when playing at home this year, that new and less well-known stigma will persist.
Last year I forecast the Saints to play the NFL’s 18th easiest schedule. Almost directly on the money, the Saints ended the season having played the 17th easiest schedule. In 2020, I project the Saints will play the tenth-toughest schedule.
The good news lies in the venues for their toughest games. The Saints play seven games against teams forecast to have a winning record in 2020 and only two of the seven will be on the road (Buccaneers and Eagles). This gives them the benefit of not needing to travel. In years past, home field would be a massive edge as well in these tilts, but
we don’t yet know if that benefit will exist this season.</p>
<p>40-year old Drew Brees was as good as ever in 2019. Brees posted a career-high 7.1% touchdown rate and led the NFL in completion percentage (74.3%) for the third consecutive season, his fourth straight season completing at least 70% of his passes. Even with backup Teddy Bridgewater starting five games, the Saints led the NFL in success rate through the air as a team at 53% in 2019, their fourth straight season pacing the league in that area on the strength of Brees’s efficiency. In terms of EPA via their passing offense, the Saints ranked second in the league behind only the Chiefs. Turning 41-years-old this offseason, Brees re-signed with the Saints to push for another Super Bowl ring. Bridgewater has moved on via free agency, but the Saints added Jameis Winston behind Brees to go along with the jack-of-all-trades usage of Taysom Hill.</p>
<p>The Saints receiving unit was anchored by NFL Offensive Player of the Year Michael Thomas. A year after becoming the first non-running back to catch 80% of his intended targets on 100 or more opportunities, Thomas set an NFL record with 149 receptions on 185 targets (80.5%). For the season, Thomas led the league in target share (31.8%), percentage of team receptions (35.7%), yardage receiving (38.9%), and yards per team pass attempt (2.97). Outside of Thomas securing the top team success rate to wide receivers (64%), the Saints also ranked ninth in success rate targeting their tight ends (56%). With another veteran added this offseason in Emmanuel Sanders, the Saints project to still have one the best receiving outlooks of 2020.</p>
<p>Not just efficient through the air, the Saints ranked third in the league in success rate rushing the football (54%), but were 16th in the league in yards per play (4.3) in that area. Alvin Kamara ranked fourth in the league in rate of runs to gain six or more yards (32%) among all backs with 100 or more carries on the season, while Latavius Murray was 25th (25%). Where New Orleans gained extra leverage running the ball was effectively using Taysom Hill, who had a 67.7% success rate rushing and 7.4% rate over average on his 27 attempts. With all of Kamara, Murray, and Hill returning plus four out of their five starting offensive lineman from a year ago, the Saints are set up for similar success in 2020.</p>
<p>Keep Buying Alvin Kamara as a fantasy RB1
While 252 touches for 1,330 yards is hardly a disappointing season, fantasy owners were not lifted to the ceiling heights showcased over Kamara’s first two seasons in the NFL in 2019. After producing 83.6% and 91.8% of the RB1 overall scoring output in each of his first two seasons, Kamara produced 52.7% of the RB1 output in 2019. In fact, Kamara’s yards per touch and yards per target have all decreased from his previous season in each of his years in the league.
Despite the decline, Kamara still has a plethora of positives in terms of usage and team attachment. For one, the opportunity is still there. Kamara has averaged over 18.0 touches per game in each of the past two years and has exactly 81 receptions in each of his first three seasons. Last season was the first time in his career that Kamara ran on the cold end of touchdown variance. After scoring 33 rushing and receiving touchdowns through two full NFL seasons, Kamara reached the end zone just seven times in 2019, scoring just twice through Week 14. That scoring variance began to oscillate back in his favor to close the season, scoring five touchdowns over his final three games played, but by then it was largely too late for the majority of fantasy rosters.
Playing for an offense that has ranked fourth, second, and third in offensive touchdowns over the past three seasons, his attachment to scoring opportunities is still among the league’s best. Kamara out-carried Latavius Murray 7-to-3 inside of the 5-yard line a year ago, but the team had just 13 total rushing attempts from that area of the field last year as opposed to Kamara’s first two seasons in the league. As a team, 75% of the New Orleans offensive touchdowns came via the pass (fourth) as Drew Brees posted a career-high 7.1% touchdown rate. In Kamara’s first two seasons, the Saints were second (50%) and fourth (53.5%) in rushing touchdown rate.
Lastly, Kamara also suffered a midseason ankle injury that played a role in his efficiency decline. Through six weeks, Kamara had forced a missed tackle on a league-leading 31.9% of his touches and he averaged 5.5 yards per touch. Once returning to the lineup in Week 10, Kamara forced a missed tackle on just 13.5% of his touches for the remainder of the season and averaged 5.1 yards per touch.
Proceed with Caution: Jared Cook
After years of unfulfilled promise, Jared Cook delivered a year ago. At age 33 and tied to Brees, Cook set career-highs in touchdowns (nine) and yards per catch (16.4) in his first year with the Saints. However, he ran ultra-hot with a 13.9% touchdown rate that masked his 4.6 targets per game. That target volume per game ranked 19th at the position. Over the past 10 seasons, Cook’s 13.9% touchdown rate per target ranks seventh among the 120 top-12 scoring seasonal tight ends. But his 65 targets rank 118th out of 120 top-12 scoring seasonal tight ends and his 46 receptions rank 119th from the same group. Attachment to Brees and the Saints offense is still a major pro for Cook and the tight end position is a low bar to maintain relevance, but Cook will need a major volume spike at age 34 or be forced to sustain his career-highs in efficiency. With the addition of Emmanuel Sanders to go along with the already target-rich options in Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara, that potential surge in added volume is hard to project.</p>
<p>New Orleans has turned into one of the league’s better units. Even with a rough start to last season, the defense turned around to play at a high level at the back end of 2019. Each position group has both depth and quality.
Sheldon Rankins has been a good presence in the interior and there’s a decent amount of depth behind him. Mario Edwards had an impressive pressure rate as a rotational tackle last season and while he’s maybe the fourth-most important player here, he could get some more time because of the pass rush. David Onyemata and Malcom Brown are solid run defenders who don’t offer much against the pass.
Cameron Jordan remains one of the league’s most underrated pass rushers though he’ll turn 31 years old in July. Jordan is getting rotated out a bit more than he had been in previous seasons, but is still on the field often. He played 82.6% of the Saints’ defensive snaps last season which is still a high number but he went from 2012-2017 playing at least 90% in each of those seasons. Behind him, Marcus Davenport has emerged as a plus pass rusher a few seasons after the Saints traded up for him in the first round. Trey Hendrickson also flashed as an athletic third-round pick from 2017 who got on the field for 38% of the defensive snaps last season. As a team, the Saints led the league in pressure rate last season per SIS.
The Saints traded up for Zack Baun in the third round and has the ability to play both edge and off-ball linebacker, which perfectly fits with how New Orleans uses the players on the second level.
Demario Davis is one of the best all-around linebackers in the league — elite in coverage, run defense, and blitzing. Alex Anzalone was a solid tackler in 2018 before his injury-shortened 2019. Even Kiko Alonso showed better ability last season than he had in previous stops. The Saints barely spend time in base (just 16% of plays in 2019, the fourth-lowest rate in the league per SIS) so only two linebackers will see the field on most plays.
New Orleans’s corner group is pretty stacked, especially with the return of Janoris Jenkins, who was great after he was signed midseason. Marshon Lattimore struggled a bit early in the season but improved as the season went along. Patrick Robinson is back to man the slot. Those are three above-average starters the Saints can rotate, which also helps with their deep safety group. New Orleans could add a little more youth into this group if they wanted and could potentially do that for added depth in the draft.
The Saints had a deep rotation at safety and then thought, “what if we also bring Malcolm Jenkins back?” Jenkins, Marcus Williams, and Chauncey Gardner-Johnson make for a trio of safeties who can play deep, in the box, or slot corner and be good all around the field.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of the seven games the Saints play against teams forecast to have a losing record, five come on the road. Much was made a few years ago about the Saints’ poor performance on the road compared to home, and that wasn’t untrue. From 2012-2017 the Saints went 20-30 on the road as compared to 31-18 at home. But during that stretch on the road, the Saints won 56% of games against teams with losing records and are now 17-8 (68%) since 2012 on the road against teams below .500, and they cover 60% of these games as well. In fact, since 2016, the Saints are 10-2 in these situations, and their 83% ATS mark is the best in the NFL.
There has been only one year in the last four where the Saints swept the Falcons. And now that they play the Falcons twice in three weeks, it makes a sweep even less likely despite the Falcons projected to be much worse in 2020. That is because teams that won the first meeting and then play again two weeks later are 6-17 (30%) in the next game. They drop from 23-0 to 6-17. Meanwhile, had they played four or five weeks later, the team that won the first game wins 70% of the time in the second meeting. So this inherently hurts the favorite, in this case, the Saints.
The Saints offense moves from playing the 15th-toughest schedule of pass defenses to sixth-toughest, and their defense shifts from playing the 17th-toughest schedule to seventh-toughest.
The Saints have made the postseason in each of the last three years. Their ultimate losses each of those seasons came at the hands of two of the most intelligent defensive minds we have in the NFL: Wade Phillips and Mike Zimmer. Two of the losses were in overtime and one was the Minneapolis Miracle, which saw the Saints up one with 10 seconds left and lose on a walk-off, 61-yard touchdown. There is nothing to say this team needs anything more than to maintain, improve in a couple of areas and get a little bit of luck.</p>
