When drafting a running back second overall, you hope defenses are worried about stopping him. You hope they try to stop him by loading up the box, which in turn would
free up pass efficiency. But that didn’t happen often last year.
Defenses didn’t load up to stop the run out of fear for Saquon Barkley. .

.On first downs in the first three quarters, the NFL average running back faced 8+ men .boxes on 25% of attempts. The Giants faced 8+ men boxes on 26% of attempts. Barkley .himself was only at 26% — just 1% above the league average.

.But compare the production vs the league average on these first down runs against .loaded boxes:

Barkley: 2.7 YPC, 27% success, -0.11 EPA/att

Next, look at these same first down runs vs seven-man boxes, which he faced on 46% of
his first down rushing attempts (a rate identical to the NFL average):


NFL avg: 4.7 YPC, 47% success, -0.02 EPA/att
Barkley: 3.3 YPC, 44% success, -0.15 EPA/att
But against six-man boxes on first down, Barkley was at his best:
NFL avg: 4.8 YPC, 47% success, 0.02 EPA/att Barkley: 5.9 YPC, 50% success, 0.13 EPA/att
The problem was, Barkley rarely faced six or fewer man boxes.
So, how could the Giants get more six-man boxes for Barkley? Well, for starters they have to be in three wide receiver sets.
On first downs in the first three quarters, when the Giants were NOT in 11 personnel, defenses had 7+ men in the box on 98% of rushing attempts. These were runs from 12 personnel, 21 personnel, or 22 personnel. On those runs, Barkley averaged just 2.5 YPC, 35% success, and -0.22 EPA/att. In other words, abysmal.
Of 41 rushers with at least 25 attempts, Barkley ranked as follows on his 43 attempts:
• 41st in YPC (2.5)
• 39th in success rate (35%) • 37th in EPA/att (-0.22)
The Giants were terrible when trying to run without 3+ wide receivers on the field. And it’s clearly represented in the “Success by Play Type & Primary Personnel Groupings” table later in this chapter.
The problem for the Giants was they never made defenses pay for anything.
On first down in the first three quarters, when defenses flooded coverage and left just six or fewer men in the box, the Giants played right into it, passing the ball 68% of the time. These passes averaged 7.5 YPA, but recorded -0.09 EPA/att. This can be compared to Barkley’s runs against light boxes which we just discussed, where he averaged 0.13 EPA/att. That’s a 0.22 EPA/play swing.
While the Giants didn’t make defenses pay for playing coverage, they didn’t make defenses pay for loading the box, either. When defenses had 8+ defenders in the box, the Giants ran the ball on 61% of these first downs, playing right into the defense’s hands. As mentioned, Barkley was terrible running on first down against loaded boxes, much worse than the NFL average (2.7 YPC, 27% success, and -0.11 EPA/att) while passes gained 8.4 YPA with 52% success and 0.0 EPA/att.
Perhaps new offensive coordinator Jason Garrett will give quarterback Daniel Jones more command at the line of scrimmage. Or perhaps he’ll encourage run plays early and often, as he did when he called plays in Dallas.
On early downs in the first half of games, the Giants went 55% pass, which was just above the NFL average pass rate. In Dallas, Jason Garrett oversaw a team that drafted Ezekiel Elliott in 2016 and went 49% run in these same situations (fifth-most run-heavy), 47% run in 2017 (third-most run-heavy), and 51% run in 2018 (11th-most run-heavy). This coincided with a young QB in Dak Prescott at the helm.
I would be stunned if Jason Garrett went 55% pass in early downs in the first half of games in 2020, as the Giants did last year. I strongly believe the Giants will go more run-heavy than 2019. That’s good news for Saquon Barkley fantasy stock if it happens, but the key is, the Giants need to pass when the defense loads the box and run when the defense goes light. I wonder if Garrett will implement his run structure using his own preferences, or if he will study enough of the Giants the last two years to see that they struggle running the ball unless it’s to the right of center. Take a look at these YPC by direction, first in 2019 and then 2018:
2.8 YPC – Left Edge 4.3YPC–LT 3.6YPC–LG 3.6YPC–C 5.2YPC–RG
5.0 YPC – RT
5.7 YPC – Right Edge
2018:
3.8 YPC – Left edge 3.4 YPC – LT
2.9 YPC – LG
3.5 YPC – C
7.6 YPC – RG
8.6 YPC – RT
5.4 YPC – Right Edge
Two consecutive years and very consistent results. Behind center or to the left of center produces below-average rushing results, but to the right produces well above average results.
For Barkley’s stock to reachits ceiling, he needs red zone touches, touchdowns, and a positive game script. Therefore, the Giants need to get first down right (unlike last year), because of how big early downs are to their results. When they won the early down battle last year, they went 3-2. When they lost, they went 1-10.

One of the two real losses when the Giants won the EDSR battle came in Week 7 against the Cardinals. The Giants were -3 in turnover margin and lost by only six points. Turnovers trump virtually everything, and were it not for a -3 margin, the Giants likely are 4-1 when winning the EDSR battle and 1-10 when losing it.
That Giants went 2-5 in one-score games last year, which was actually a decrease in results given they were 4-8 in 2018. It’s easy to suggest that such records are due to regress, But in these five losses, the Giants actually won the turnover battle in three of five, and lost the EDSR battle in two of those three. Those games should have been larger losses for the Giants — they were fortunate the game was within one score.
The Giants also have some work to do to improve passing efficiency, but there are a couple key things that, if enhanced, could pay quick dividends.
Looking at receiving efficiency from 2019, all wide receivers delivered reasonable returns from a success and EPA perspective. However, the biggest shock was the inefficiency from the tight end position. Typically, tight end is a young quarterback’s best friend. Routes that tight ends run are generally easy for quarterbacks to target. Additionally, they are run in an area of the field where passes typically see success. Finally, they usually have matchup advantages purely due to size over the defenders assigned to cover them in routes.
So it was stunning to see Evan Engram, a year after delivering 0.26 EPA/att (better than Odell Beckham) and receiving 9.0 YPA, struggle as he did in 2019. Engram recorded just 6.8 YPA, a 41% success rate, and 0.07 EPA/att. Of any receiver targeted at least 30 times, it was the worst on the Giants.
Engram’s aDOT was only 6.1 yards, so these were not deep, difficult passes. The difference in production by route type was astonishing. Look at the two routes he ran the most, with at least 12 targets on each last year:
Outs: -0.50 EPA/att, 31% success, 3.2 YPA, 67 rating Curls: 0.24 EPA/att, 50% success, 7.4 YPA, 96 rating
If Jason Garrett can improve the chemistry between Engram and Jones, it will go a long way to improving the Giants passing efficiency.

Another way to improve Jones’s efficiency is through the use of play-action. But not just any play action: shotgun play-action.

The Giants had massive play-action splits, but used it at near-average rates. On early downs in the first three quarters:
- With P/A: 9.0 YPA, 59% success, 0.20 EPA/att - W/O P/A: 6.0 YPA, 43% success, -0.14 EPA/att
But the real edge wasn’t play-action from under center and sticking it in the belly of Barkley before pulling it. The real edge was shotgun play-action, as these splits show:
- Under center P/A: 6.9 YPA, 50% success, -0.11 EPA/att (55 att) - Shotgun P/A: 10.9 YPA, 67% success, 0.48 EPA/att, (60 att)
The Giants were barely better with under center play-action than when they didn’t use any at all. But they were volumes better when using shotgun play-action in 2019.
With regard to Jones, here is a notable nugget: he ranked 22nd in completed air yards, 22nd in air yards vs YAC, but third in aggressiveness rank and 33rd in expected completion percentage. This was very problematic. Breaking it down, ranking below average in completed air yards means he’s not throwing deep down the field. The longer a throw, the less likely it is to get completed. So, he was throwing shorter passes which should be more likely completed. But let’s tackle the aggressiveness ranking next. Aggressiveness is a player tracking stat, and measures the amount of passing attempts a quarterback makes that are into tight coverage, where there is a defender within one yard or less of the receiver at the time of completion or incompletion. This means that even though Jones was throwing short, he was still throwing into tight coverage. And that’s echoed in his expected completion percentage, which measures probability of a pass completion, based on numerous factors such as receiver separation from the nearest defender, where the receiver is on the field and the separation the passer had at the time of throw from the nearest pass rusher. There shouldn’t be a need to be so aggressive (third of 39 QBs) with passes that have super low expected completion (33rd of 39 QBs) when you’re throwing well below average depth of target. This is something that Jason Garrett needs to fix. Jones also had a massive drop off when he moved off of his first read.
It seems like no team in the league faces worse scheduling than the Giants, and the story is unchanged in 2020. Not only do the Giants face the second-toughest schedule in the NFL this year based on opponents, they are the only team in the NFL to play three short-rest road games as well. After their Week 1 Monday night game, they must play on the road in Chicago on short rest. Then they have to play Thursday night in Philadelphia. Then, they play another Monday night game (this time against the Buccaneers) and are on the road the following week. In their first 10 games the Giants don’t play a single other team forecast to produce a losing record in 2020 aside from the Redskins. And most of their opponents are forecast to produce over nine wins. Last year, Daniel Jones benefitted from facing the NFL’s 19th toughest slate of pass defenses. In 2020, they face the 10th toughest opposing pass defenses. And they start the season playing four straight top-10 pass defenses, the second-toughest schedule of any passing offense to start the season. But where the schedule gets much worse is for the Giants defense.

The Giants closed 2019 ranking 24th in success rate passing (42%), 24th in yards per pass attempt (6.7 yards), and 27th in expected points added via their passing offense. After selecting Daniel Jones with the sixth overall pick in last year’s draft, the rookie found the field starting in Week 3. There were low points. Jones ranked 35th among all quarterbacks with at least four starts in yards per attempt (6.6 yards) and 30th in completion rate (61.9%), but there were also some highs. Jones was just the second rookie passer to have three games with four or more touchdown passes and had five 300-yard passing games. His 24 touchdown passes overall on the season were good for third all-time by a rookie. Jones was pressured on 41% of his dropbacks (second highest) and sacked on 7.6%, but improvement still has to be made without pressure, where Jones ranked 24th in yards per pass attempt (7.0) from a clean pocket.


Despite multiple missed games from Sterling Shepard, Golden Tate, and Darius Slayton, Giants wide receivers did collectively have a 52% success rate (14th) per target despite ranking 21st in yards per target (7.4). Slayton (48-740-8) was a major positive as a rookie, leading the team in snaps played at receiver and matching the league lead with eight touchdown receptions among rookie wideouts despite being the 18th receiver selected. Where the Giants really struggled was ranking 32nd in success rates targeting both their tight ends (41%) and running backs (35%). Both Evan Engram and Saquon Barkley missed time, but there is far too much talent at those positions to come in at the bottom of the league.

As a team, the Giants ranked 18th in rushing success rate (48%), 11th in expected points added via rushing, and sixth in yards per carry (4.7 YPC) despite their head pin in Saquon Barkley checking in below his rookie season output. Barkley has been a volatile runner over his two years in the league, ranking 48th (44%) and 60th (41%) in success rate the past two seasons, but he ranks second in rushing yardage (1,371 yards) and touchdowns (nine) on carries that have gained 10 or more yards. An early-season ankle injury and Barkley’s line compounded the nature of his style as he ranked 34th in yards before contact (1.8) after averaging 2.2 YBC (24th) as a rookie while forcing a missed tackle once every 13.6 carries as opposed to once every 8.7 in 2018. Improvements up front, a clean bill of health and new offensive scheme will help Barkley.


Sorting out the Giants Passing Game
The Giants did not have all of Saquon Barkley, Evan Engram, Sterling Shepard, Golden Tate, and Darius Slayton all on the field at the same time for a single snap in 2019. Shepard, Tate, and Engram played just one game together while the three wideouts played just six games together. To compound matters, Daniel Jones played in just four of those six games. In the one game the Giants had everyone but Barkley, Engram led the team with 11 targets, followed by Shepard (nine), Tate (six), and Slayton (five). In the four games all three wideouts played with Jones, Shepard (21-179-1) led the team with 35 targets, followed by Tate (22-of-32 for 210-2) and Slayton (12-of-23 for 179-1).
All in all, we have one big mess on our hands. Shepard was his best without Tate active (16.8 PPG) and the inverse was true about Tate with Shepard inactive (17.6 PPG) and both averaged fewer points when they played with Engram on the field. Slayton averaged 14.2 PPG with Engram sidelined as opposed to 9.4 points with him on the field.
Shepard averaged a career-high 5.7 catches per game in 2019 and had at least five catches in all four of the games all three wideouts played with Jones. But he also averaged career-low 10.1 yards per catch. Shepard has scored just nine touchdowns over the past three seasons and has now had three official concussions while in the league plus migraine issues that have bothered him in the past. Tate will be 32 years old at the start of the season, having posted a 19-272-3 line (10.7 PPG) in the six games he played with both Shepard and Slayton also active as opposed to a 30-404-3 line when Shepard was out. Slayton is the most intriguing of the three because he is coming off a strong rookie season and does not carry injury the stigma of Shepard. But he does not come without volume concerns even with an expected year two jump in usage. He is also due for expected touchdown regression. Slayton scored eight times when his expected touchdown total based on target opportunity on the field was just 3.5 scores.
Struggling to find consistency with a rookie passer, Engram had 6-113-1 in his first game with Daniel Jones then combined for 21-190-1 over his other five games played with Jones under center. Engram plays the palatable fantasy position to chase here, but he has now missed 13 games over the past two seasons. That missed time has kept Engram outside of the top-12 end of season scorers in each of the past two seasons, but he has been the TE7 in PPR points per game in each of those years. Engram has scored six times in 19 games the past two seasons after scoring six times in 15 games as a rookie, but the targets are still there. Engram averaged 21.5% of the team's targets per game in 2019, a rate that would have ranked sixth at the position over a full season.
The easy answer would be to just select Daniel Jones and let the chips fall where they may week to week given just about everyone here is a concern to miss more time at some stage outside of Slayton given the history between Engram and Shepard plus Tate’s age.
If playing the options here, Engram is the top target based on scarcity at the position, but he is also the only player here that costs you anything of real significance in terms of draft equity. All of the wideouts do not carry a lot of downside at their cost since everyone at that stage has it. I prefer Shepard for his target and reception floor in reception-based formats, but Slayton and Tate both carry upside based on year two growth for Slayton and the injuries surrounding Engram and Shepard.

The Giants doubled down on the bizarre Leonard Williams trade by giving him the franchise tag this offseason. He’ll count for $16.1 million on the 2020 cap for being pretty good. The depth for the Giants’ interior line was good before the Williams trade. They had just used a first-round pick on Dexter Lawrence and Dalvin Tomlinson had shown some pass rush production to add on to his run-stopping. Tomlinson is in the last year of his rookie deal but was the best run defender on the line. The Williams trade derailed the progression of 2018 third-round pick B.J. Hill, who was impressive as a starter during his rookie season.
On an offseason conference call, general manager Dave Gettleman said he believes the Giants can create their pass rush with scheme and, boy, are they going to have to with this group. The Giants were 17th in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate last season and 23rd in team pressure rate per SIS.
Markus Golden was the team’s only consistent threat as a pass rusher in 2019. He was hit with a rare UFA tag, so he may or may not be back by the end of July.
Free agent addition Kyler Fackrell is somewhere between his 10.5-sack 2018 season and 1.0-sack 2019. Oshane Ximines showed some flashes as a third-round rookie
but 2018 third-round pick Lorenzo Carter hasn’t been able to find a groove as a pass rusher.
Blake Martinez was a tackle machine in Green Bay, whose responsibilities were to make clean up tackles and not much else. Ryan Connelly played well above expectations for a fifth-round rookie before a torn ACL cost him the remainder of the 2019 season just four weeks in. David Mayo found his way into playing time because of the Connelly injury and could be the starter at the beginning of the year.
The Giants have used a lot of resources at cornerback over the past two seasons and it’s still not a great group. The addition of James Bradberry, who played well covering No. 1 corners in the NFC South, will give the Giants a top corner. DeAndre Baker struggled mightily his rookie season before any off-field troubles came during the offseason. 2018 Supplemental Draft pick Sam Beal came on at the end of the season after Janoris Jenkins was waived, but he’s still played just six games over two seasons.
Beal could be in for more time in the slot, where the Giants had no answers in 2019. Grant Haley fell out of favor and no corner with 100 or more coverage snaps allowed more Adjusted Yards (factoring in touchdowns and interceptions) or was targeted more often than Corey Ballentine. 2020 fifth-round pick Darnay Holmes will be in contention for the slot role, though he played just 10% of his snaps inside last year at UCLA.
Julian Love played a bit of a slot/safety hybrid last season and could bounce around the secondary wherever help is needed. Second-round pick Xavier McKinney gives the Giants an immediate upgrade at safety with a mix of plus instincts and athleticism. Jabrill Peppers was fine as the box safety but missed the final five games of the season with a back injury.
