<p>The Texans are built like a team would be if they want to rally around a young
quarterback. They have just the 23rd most cap space allotted to the position, and are
top-10 in cap spending to the offensive line and wide receiver corps. You want a good, .young quarterback and you want to give him protection.
From a pass blocking perspective, the Texans offensive line ranked eighth in ESPN’s .Pass Block Win Rate metric and sixth in overall pass blocking grades. The dollars paid
off in individual performance along the line.</p>
<p>However, we know a quarterback is a big part of the picture when it comes to controlling
sack rate. And despite what was viewed through either player tracking data or trained
graders as top-10 performance from the line, Deshaun Watson took on pressure on 38% .of his 2019 dropbacks, the sixth-highest rate in the NFL.
It was better than 2018, where he was the most under-pressure quarterback in the NFL at
44.7%. That was better than 2017, where he was the most under-pressure QB in the NFL at 47.7%.</p>
<p>But it still isn’t ideal. The problem for Watson is that he wants to make plays. (And truthfully, given his defense, he needs to make plays.) One look at his completion .
percentage by target depth graphics and you’ll see how brilliant Watson is when going deep. And that takes time. His time in the pocket was second-highest in the NFL. His time until he took a sack was third-highest in the NFL. His time to run was fourth-highest in the NFL.
Spending a lot on the line and getting better pass protection is a good thing for a young quarterback, but keeping him out of pressured situations via his own adjustments as well as your coaching and route design is just as important.</p>
<p>And the Texans still have work to do there.
Beyond a cheap quarterback and expensive offensive line, the Texans have other issues with the salary cap which are less than ideal: the third-highest cap hit to wide receivers and to running backs.
Houston didn’t want to pay their second-best player, DeAndre Hopkins, so they traded him away and took back David Johnson’s ridiculous running back contract and draft capital. And yet the Texans still have the third-most salary cap tied into the wide receiver position this year.
How could that be possible?
First, by signing free agent Randall Cobb to a $27 million contract and giving him an average salary only eclipsed by 27 other wide receivers across the entire NFL.
The Texans also took on two expensive wide receiver contracts via trades, for Brandin Cooks ($8 million cap hit) and Kenny Stills ($7 million cap hit).
There are 25 NFL teams paying a wide receiver at least a $6 million in 2020 cap hit. Three of the 25 teams are paying more than two wide receivers $6 million. But the only team paying cap charges of at least $6 million to four receivers is the Houston Texans.
Aside from the three just mentioned, the most bizarre situation is the only home-grown receiver of the bunch: Will Fuller.
It is difficult to find talent in the NFL and even more difficult to find talent at the receiver position. Since the new CBA introduced fifth-year options, 28 receivers have been drafted in the first round with the option available. Only 15 of 28 were given the option — 54%. That’s the lowest “hit rate” for any position with at least 12 players drafted.
Of those 15, only two players received the fifth-year option and either did not receive an extension, a trade, or were cut before that fifth-year kicked in: Kendall Wright and Nelson Agholor. Those were the only two receivers drafted in the first round, out of 28 since 2011, who played on the fifth-year option all the way through. Fuller is set to be the third.
Bill O’Brien wasn’t the acting general manager when the Texans drafted Fuller, but he was when the Texans decided to give Fuller the fifth-year option. A big reason why it’s so rare to play on the fifth-year option is the price structure. Take Fuller for example:
His cap hits have been between $2 million and $3 million over the last four years. But because of the fifth-year option in 2020, his cap hit jumps all the way to $10.2M. That’s substantial. For that reason, for most teams that actually like their receiver, they sign them for a long-term deal at much cheaper cap hits. Or, they just let him walk in free agency. Or, they trade him. But it is extremely rare to allow the receiver to occupy such a high cap hit if you actually like him and allow him to hit free agency the next offseason.</p>
<p>But that is exactly what is happening with Fuller. O’Brien chose to pay him $10.2 million for a one-year rental, and allow him to hit free agency next spring. The two other receivers who let their first-round pick play out his fifth year did not re-sign them in free agency. Both went to new teams.
Which takes me back to the top of this discussion, the difficulty in finding talent in the NFL.
This offseason, the Texans could have worked out a deal with DeAndre Hopkins, one of their former first-round draft picks. And they could have created cap space by giving Fuller an extension. These are two first-round picks of the Texans and it’s likely both will be gone.
Back to the salary cap problems, Houston has the third-most cap space tied up at
the running back position. And who do they have in that stable?</p>
<p>David Johnson has averaged no better than 3.7 YPC the last two years and was phased out of the Cardinals offense. Behind him is receiving back Duke Johnson, who I like in that role. But beyond that, there is precious little as the Texans no longer have Carlos Hyde or Lamar Miller. Buddy Howell is currently next in line behind David Johnson as the standard back, and he has five career rushing attempts despite logging two years in the NFL.
Once Watson’s rookie deal expires and the Texans no longer have the good fortune of paying peanuts for outstanding quarterback play, there will be no way they can afford top-10 cap hits to the offensive line, wide receiver, and running back positions. But what does the future hold for 2020 before Watson inevitably breaks the bank?
To answer that question, let’s start at the beginning — with last year’s book. Last year’s Texans chapter started by focusing on strength of schedule. Specifically, the Texans posting an 11-5 record and how it was entirely exaggerated thanks to the defense ranking seventh-best in efficiency and fourth-best in EDSR. But that was on account of the ridiculous quarterbacks they faced. The Texans played the NFL’s easiest schedule of passing offenses any team has seen in the last four years.
I predicted this seemingly top-10 defense would regress massively. Because they would not face such a ridiculous schedule of quarterbacks in 2019 as they did in 2018.
After facing the NFL’s easiest schedule of pass offenses in 2018, in last year’s book I forecast the Texans would face the fifth-toughest schedule of passing offenses in 2019.
When all was said and done last year, the Texans faced the fifth-toughest schedule of passing offenses, exactly as I forecast. As they say, the ball isn’t going to spike itself.
Defensively, the 2019 Texans were bad across the board. One look at their defensive metrics paints the picture. In 12 of 13 metrics, they are pushing bottom-10 if not bottom-5. They were terrible against these better passing attacks and ranked 26th against the pass.
With a much tougher schedule of offenses faced and a terrible defense, how was it then that the 2019 Texans won 10 games and made the playoffs?
The bottom line is variance. Statistically, they were not a team that should have won 10 games. But they were able to go 5-1 in games decided by a field goal.
And then there were the halftime deficits erased along with fourth-quarter comebacks.
Historically, teams find it difficult to come back from halftime deficits. Last year, 81% of the time a team was trailing at halftime, they lost the game. That was slightly worse than historical averages of 77%.
Some of the best quarterbacks in the NFL are capable of routinely bringing their teams back into games and pulling out victories.
The best in the NFL the last three years has been a tie between Ben Roethlisberger and Nick Foles, who both led their teams back to wins in 50% of the games they trailed at halftime (each with a record of 5-5).</p>
<p>Aaron Rodgers is 10-11 (48%). Drew Brees is 9-10 (47%). Russell Wilson is 12-17 (41%). No other quarterbacks are close to them. Not even the best in the game right now. Patrick Mahomes is 1-5 (17%). Lamar Jackson is 0-5. Tom Brady is 3-11 (21%). Philip Rivers is 4-17 (19%). Matthew Stafford is 3-15 (17%).
The quarterbacks I would trust most in these spots in 2020 are probably guys like Patrick Mahomes and Russell Wilson, and even their track record won’t get the W more times than not.
Through two NFL seasons, Watson’s Texans trailed at halftime in eight games. They went 0-8 in those games. Pulling off second half comebacks is not easy. But in 2019, the Texans went 4-5 (44%) in games they trailed at halftime.
Week 3, the Texans trailed the Chargers 17-7. Watson willed them back on the shoulders of 3/4 to Hopkins for 56 yards and 3/5 to tight end Jordan Akins, who scored two touchdowns. Houston’s running backs in the second half gained a total of 15 yards.
Week 5, the Texans trailed the Falcons by one point. To be fair, this game was dominated by the Texans early, and it was a travesty they were down. I remember betting the over in the game, and also had the Texans. I re-upped on the Texans at halftime. Houston blew them out in the second half, scoring 37 in that half alone. Hopkins and Fuller both carried the load in the second half. Hopkins was 6/6 for 74 yards with four first downs. Fuller was 6/7 for 116 yards and four first downs. This time, tight end Darren Fells caught two red zone touchdowns.
Week 8, the Texans were down to the Raiders. Watson targeted Hopkins eight times in the second half: 7/8, 66 yards, and six first downs. No other player had over half those eight targets. But Watson once again hit Fells for two red zone touchdowns and the Texans won.
In the Wild Card game, the Texans were down 13-0 at halftime. They came back to tie the game thanks to 70 yards on 4/4 to DeAndre Hopkins, who had no scores but did the heavy lifting (no other receiver had more than 20 yds in the second half) to get the Texans back into the game.
Watson is too good to post an 0-8 record in games down at halftime, and 2019 was the breakout year where he took over. But a large part of that dominance
was thanks to their most productive receiver, DeAndre Hopkins.</p>
<p>Last season, Houston was a top-10 passing team in success rate (48%), missed yards per pass attempt (3.1) yards to successful play (35%) rate, yards above successful rate (66%), and EPA while they were 12th in yards per pass attempt (7.6 Y/A). With 7.8 yards per pass attempt and a 5.3% touchdown rate in 2019, Deshaun Watson is the first quarterback to average over 7.0 yards per pass attempt and a 5.0% touchdown rate in each of his first three NFL seasons since Dan Marino. Watson has never played a game without DeAndre Hopkins active, so 2020 will be a unique experience. Watson has averaged 9.2 Y/A to non-Hopkins wideouts to start his career, but the influence of Hopkins on the field is also in play with that total.</p>
<p>Houston ranked ninth in the league in yards per pass attempt (8.7 yards) and second in success rate (58%) targeting their wide receivers. Gone now is DeAndre Hopkins, who accounted for 28% of those targets. Hopkins was 12th in the league in success rate per target (58%), but Will Fuller (59%), Kenny Stills (59%), and Randall Cobb (53%) were also above league average with new addition Brandin Cooks a wild card. That group has some durability concerns, but is still stocked with highly-functional talent. Houston also has both David Johnson (49%) and Duke Johnson (47%), who were above average success rate out of the backfield in 2019. The only soft spot is tight end, where Houston ranked 20th in yards per pass attempt (7.0) to tight ends.</p>
<p>In the run game, Houston was sixth in the league in success rate (51%) and seventh in the league in EPA on the ground, but below league average in yards above success rate and yards to successful play rate. Most of their highly efficient runs stemmed from Watson. Carlos Hyde was good at getting positive runs (51% success rate), but he was let go in favor of trading for David Johnson, who was 61st in success rate (43%) rushing a year ago and 74th in 2018 (38%). Houston has 59.6% of their 2019 team rushing attempts vacated, which is the most in the league. Despite his struggles over the past two seasons, the crux of those will be going to the 29-year-old Johnson with Duke Johnson operating in the same capacity he has over the start of his career.</p>
<p>New Look Texans
With the trade of DeAndre Hopkins and letting Carlos Hyde leave via free agency, Houston is without 45.8% of their offensive touches from ago. Paired with the additions of David Johnson, Brandin Cooks, and Randall Cobb, the Houston offense has a ton of moving parts.
Deshaun Watson has ranked as the QB1, QB2, and QB4 in fantasy points per game over his first three seasons while averaging over 5.0 rushing points per game in each of those three seasons. To begin Watson’s career, Hopkins has accounted for 31.9% of Watson’s passing targets, 32.7% of completed passes, 34.3% of his passing yardage, and 35.2% of his passing touchdowns. Watson has averaged 9.2 Y/A to non-Hopkins wideouts to start his career, but the influence of Hopkins on the field is also in play with that total.
Watson has ranked first (19.6%), 22nd (11.1%), and fifth (14.9%) in rate of deep passing attempts (throws 20-plus yards downfield) to start his career, so surrounding him with a cupboard full of downfield passing game weapons such as Will Fuller, Brandin Cooks, and Kenny Stills makes Watson sort of similar to a high volume three-point shooter in the NBA. Adding David Johnson and Randall Cobb as intermediate targets to go with Duke Johnson also gives him weapons on the intermediate levels.
David Johnson has averaged 10.7 yards per catch over his career, and even though his rushing acumen has been nearly non-existent the past two seasons, Johnson caught 30 passes for 315 yards and three touchdowns in his first six games as a full-time back in 2019. Cobb’s 829 receiving yards a year ago were the most he has had in a season since 2015 while he averaged a career-high 15.1 yards per catch. Since entering the league in 2015, Duke Johnson’s 7.1 yards per target ranks seventh at the position and his 9.3 Y/R ranks eighth among all backs to have 100-plus targets over that span. All in all, there is still plenty of receiving talent around Watson paired with his rushing ability to keep him in play as a top-five fantasy option at this position, despite potentially having a brutal schedule to start the season.
Of course, Watson is expensive. Making the cheaper pass-catching options here more intriguing. The top two wideouts in Fuller and Cooks, especially. Fuller has been top-40 in points per game in each of the past three seasons playing with Watson, but has now missed multiple games in all four seasons of his career with 22 missed in total. Prior to last season, Cooks had reeled off five consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons and will still turn just 27-years-old this September. Both Fuller and Cooks come major durability red flags, but those are largely priced into their fantasy cost, while nearly none of their spike-week potential is accounted for.</p>
<p>Houston lost D.J. Reader to the Bengals in free agency and expected to replace him with Timmy Jernigan, but that free agent deal fell apart and Jernigan now remains unsigned. 2020 second-round pick Ross Blacklock could be thrust into a starting role without much quality depth at the position.
J.J. Watt is still JJ Watt. That’s always a positive for the Texans. Whitney Mercilus was a productive No. 2 edge last season, though he was better in his No. 3 role behind Watt and Jadeveon Clowney in past years. Behind those two, there’s little of note. Brennan Scarlett and Jacob Martin had some flashes but won’t play more than rotational roles at the position. There’s potential for third-round pick Jonathan Greenard, who had 16 tackles for loss, three forced fumbles, and four passes defensed in his final college season.
Zach Cunningham has turned into a good rangey sideline-to-sideline run defender, though his coverage ability still needs work. Still, the Texans were slightly above average defending the shallow middle of the field last season. Benardrick McKinney has also been good in a role that saw him rush the passer on 22.5% of his pass snaps, per SIS. Cunningham played 87.5% of the Houston defensive snaps last season and McKinney played 78.6%. The Texans can piece together depth, especially since either one of Cunningham or McKinney is typically on the field, so while a coverage linebacker could help, it’s not as high on the list of needs for a team in Houston’s situation.
There’s a lot of players at corner, the question is whether or not any of them are good. Houston acquired former first-round picks Gareon Conley and Vernon Hargreaves last season but both showed why the teams that picked them there wanted to move on.
The top corner will be Bradley Roby, who was the only above-average corner on the roster last season. There were 92 corners who played at least 300 coverage snaps last season. By Adjusted Yards Allowed per coverage snap, which accounts for touchdowns and interceptions Roby ranked 42nd. Lonnie Johnson, Vernon Hargreaves, and Gareon Conley ranked 86th, 87th, and 88th.
Thankfully Justin Reid has turned into a star at safety after being a third-round pick in 2018. It’s the saving grace of this secondary. Tashaun Gipson struggled in his first season with the Texans after being cut from the Jaguars and was then released by Houston. Eric Murray was added to the group in free agency, though he played mostly slot corner for the Browns last season. Jaylen Watkins could also see some time. He played 34% of the Chargers’ defensive snaps last season, mostly as a box safety on a defense that played a ton of defensive backs. Michael Thomas could be a third safety, but has been more of a special teams ace throughout his career.</p>
<p>In fact, when trailing in the second half, no receiver had recorded more first downs than Hopkins’s 28. He averaged 10.6 YPA and a 66% success rate on targets to go along with a 115 passer rating. He totaled a ridiculous 22.8 EPA.
And then there were the fourth-quarter comebacks. Prior to 2019, Watson’s Texans were 1-10 (9%) when trailing entering the fourth quarter. Watson’s 2019 Texans trailed entering the fourth quarter in a whopping eight games. History would show they would lose most of those games, but the 2019 Texans went 4-4 in those eight games. It was the best record in the NFL (min. four games trailing entering the fourth quarter). Only two other teams last year even won over two games they trailed entering the fourth quarter (the Bills and Seahawks, both with three wins). Every other team won two or fewer. Watson won four.
Last May I predicted the 2019 Texans would face the NFL’s hardest schedule. They played the seventh-toughest schedule, and it would have been the toughest were it not for Andrew Luck missing the entire season and Nick Foles going down in Week 1.
In their 2020 schedule, they play just three teams forecast to finish at-or-below .500. Every other opponent is projected to finish with a winning record. They also face the NFL’s toughest schedule the first four weeks, with four straight games against likely playoff teams.
Making this stretch even more difficult is these first four opponents each rank top-10 in pass defense. With the potential for passing attacks to struggle some immediately out of the gates and with the Texans missing DeAndre Hopkins for the first time in 2020, it could make things challenging for Deshaun Watson.
Pay attention to when the Texans face strong run offenses. In 2019 they went 2-5 against teams with top-12 run offenses and 8-3 against everyone else. They play another seven games in 2020 against teams with top-12 rushing attacks.
I didn’t expect the Texans to get the massive bump in rushing efficiency in 11 personnel from Carlos Hyde, but he delivered. He gained 5.0 YPC with a 57% success rate and 5.8 EPA. It was a huge spike from Lamar Miller (3.9 YPC, 43% success rate, and -1.9 EPA on 82 attempts) or Alfred Blue (3.1 YPC, 35% success, and -11.5 EPA on 65 attempts).
David Johnson hasn’t been anywhere close to Carlos Hyde. He gained 3.4 YPC, 34% success, and -3.5 EPA last year in Arizona. And in 2018, he was at 3.9 YPC, 36% success, and -13.1 EPA on 140 attempts from 11 personnel.
Without DeAndre Hopkins, without enough defensive improvement, without Watson getting substantially better at avoiding pressure, and without David Johnson producing Hyde-like numbers in 11 personnel runs, I have my concerns about the Texans. But it’s always a dangerous proposition to doubt, let alone bet against Deshaun Watson.</p>
