<p>Bestball is a niche form of fantasy football where a group of 12 players takes turns drafting teams of 18-20 players who will then score points in the following NFL season. A common breakdown of a 20 man roster would consist of 3 quarterbacks, 6 running backs, 8 wide recievers and 3 tight ends. Each week, a team will compile a score from the roster so that it maximizes the sum of the 8 highest scoring players, with the positional contraints of 1 quarterback, 2-3 running backs, 3-4 wide recievers and 1-2 tight ends.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed playing these contest at <a href="https://bestball10s.shgn.com/">MFL/Fanball</a> for the past few years, and they have also been popular at <a href="https://draft.com/">Draft</a>, who was acquired by a <a href="https://www.fanduel.com/">Fanduel</a> entity at the end of <a href="https://gridironexperts.com/draft-shutsdown-merges-with-fanduel">2019</a>.</p>
