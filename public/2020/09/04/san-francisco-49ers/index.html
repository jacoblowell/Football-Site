<p>The story heading into the Super Bowl was that Kyle Shanahan was handcuffed with
Jimmy Garoppolo, needed to rely on the run game, and likely wouldn’t have much of a shot against the stud prodigy Patrick Mahomes on the other side of the field.</p>
<p>I hated that narrative. Not only did I not believe it, but it was also completely lazy. People
saw Garoppolo throw only eight passes in the NFC Championship game while the Niners
ran wild. They saw Garoppolo go a dismal 11/19 for 131 yards and 1:1 TD:INT in the .NFC Divisional Round.
Talking heads and fans alike ignored reality. They focused on a small subset. They didn’t
break down the real season to see what the 49ers passing attack really was.</p>
<p>What happened in the Super Bowl?</p>
<p>The 49ers built a 10-point lead entering the fourth quarter and held that same lead with .less than seven minutes to go in the game.</p>
<p>And how did the quarterbacks look through three quarters?</p>
<ul>
<li>Jimmy G: 17/20, 9.2 YPA, 65% success, 0.36 EPA/att, 0 sacks, 5.7 aDOT</li>
<li>Mahomes: 16/25, 5.8 YPA, 48% success, -0.08 EPA/att, 2 sacks, 5.4 aDOT
The point isn’t to disparage Mahomes, the best quarterback in the NFL. It’s to praise Garoppolo. The Chiefs had the NFL’s sixth-best pass defense. No pushovers by any extreme. Not only was Garoppolo throwing deeper than Mahomes in the first three quarters, he was delivering far better efficiency. He was not only on the way to winning the game, but being named MVP.</li>
</ul>
<p>But then came the fourth quarter. Then came a couple of errant passes (one possible for a touchdown, the other, an interception). Then came the 10-point lead evaporating. Then came the 49ers defense giving up 21 fourth quarter points. In a Super Bowl.</p>
<p>And now, people are making the same exact mistakes they did leading into the game.
They’re ignoring the reality of what Garoppolo did through three quarters and are focusing only on the final quarter, when his defense and his play calling and Mahomes’ brilliance all likewise played major roles in the end result.
Far too few people remember what Garoppolo did through three quarters, so it’s important to share it. Far too few people remember what Garoppolo did during the season, so it’s important to share it.
But before we dig in, it’s important to remember one huge factor: when it comes to a quarterback and his playcaller, one thing people don’t account enough for is that these two individuals are inseparable.
Before the 2019 season, I was asked by Colin Cowherd which playcaller I’d rather have: Sean McVay or Kyle Shanahan. McVay was off two straight double-digit win seasons and a trip to the Super Bowl. Shanahan was off of two straight seasons with double-digit losses. I didn’t hesitate: my unpopular answer was (and still is) Shanahan.
Kyle Shanahan designs and calls plays to produce and to win. Period. He doesn’t care how it gets done, who gets the credit, or what the media will write afterward. As such, when we’re talking Garoppolo, there is always some Shanahan mixed in. It’s inevitable.
In 2019 the 49ers had the eighth-best passing offense despite playing the 10th-toughest schedule of pass defenses. They had a brutal schedule.
Isolate only those games Garoppolo played against top-15 pass defenses (11 of his 18 games came against top-15 pass defenses) and his numbers were:
• 8.7 YPA, 68% completions, 47% success, 96 passer rating, and a 13:10 TD:INT ratio.
Obviously, the 49ers like to be very balanced on early downs. But against these top-15 pass defenses, when put into a passing 3rd down situation, Garoppolo delivered:
• 8.5 YPA, 73% completions, 46% conversion rate, 106 rating, and a 3:1 TD:INT ratio
Let’s move beyond the best defenses and look at all defenses.
Of the 31 quarterbacks to have at least 50 early down pass attempts vs Cover 3 last year, Garoppolo ranked first in YPA (11.4), second in EPA/att (0.32), and second in success rate (65%) on his 105 attempts. He also delivered a 126 rating (second) and a 9:2 TD:INT ratio.</p>
<p>Let’s move beyond coverage to look at the preferred target location. No team passed the ball more between the numbers than the 49ers, who threw to the middle of the field on 65% of their total attempts. On the season, when passing between the numbers, Jimmy G delivered 9.2 YPA, 56% success, 109 rating, and 17:8 TD:INT. No quarterback had more total EPA when passing to the middle of the field, and his 0.36 EPA/att ranked top-5.
Let’s move beyond target location to look at this extremely important metric: the 49ers had the NFL’s most explosive passing offense of 2019. Seems shocking, I know. But 13% of their passes produced gains of 20 or more yards, best in the NFL. The NFL average was 9%. (For comparison, Mahomes and the Chiefs ranked ninth in that metric.)
No passing offense in the last four years produced explosive gains at a better rate
than the 2019 49ers.</p>
<p>The way an offense ranks first in the NFL in explosive pass rate despite throwing deep least is because Garoppolo had a 59% success rate on passes thrown over 15 air yards and averaged 16.7 YPA, both first in the NFL. And, of course, creative play designs with the goal of producing YAC.
Somehow, Garoppolo was able to deliver all of these numbers against the 10th-toughest schedule of pass defenses and once again for over three quarters of the Super Bowl against the No. 6 pass defense. But now we should ignore all of those numbers and instead focus on him not passing much in the playoffs before the Super Bowl and because of his fourth quarter?
Speaking of creative play designs, two things Shanahan has done quite well has been the usage of play-action and pre-snap motion to give his offense an edge.
The 49ers used the fourth-most play-action on early downs in the first three quarters. These passes averaged 11.6 YPA (second), 61% success (second), 0.26 EPA/att (second) and a 109 rating. They had the fifth-largest improvement in success rate and seventh-largest improvement in YPA when using play-action.
The 49ers also used the NFL’s highest rate of pre-snap motion. They used it on a whopping 70% of plays in the first three quarters – substantially higher than the NFL’s 43% average usage rate.
However, the most unique aspect of the 49ers offense isn’t the play-action or the pre-snap motion. It’s the personnel grouping they favor.
The 49ers run the ball from 21 personnel on 33% of all rushing attempts. The NFL average is 11%. There is something the teams that ran from 21 over 21% of run plays had in common:
33% - 49ers – playoffs 26% - Vikings – playoffs 25% - Saints – playoffs
Toss in the Ravens and the Patriots, both of which had 82 runs from 21 personnel last year (fourth- and fifth-most in the NFL) and you have two more playoff teams.
The 49ers were second in EPA/att from 21, fourth in YPC, and seventh in success rate.
San Francisco was also extremely adept at passing from 21 personnel, doing so on 21% of their attempts (average was 6%). These passes averaged 0.25 EPA/att, gained 9.7 YPA, with a 61% success rate.
I’ve long said teams that do something different and do it well gain an inherent edge because NFL defenses typically aren’t built to stop unique offenses with so little time to prepare. General managers draft and defensive coordinators mold defenses to play a system, and beyond that, to be able to handle opposing offenses in their own division. Non-NFC West defenses are not going to get the looks throughout the season for defending so much 21 personnel. They aren’t going to practice the run fits nearly as much. They are going to be at a disadvantage.
That’s a positive for the 49ers and Kyle Shanahan.
The 49ers, like all Super Bowl runners up, had a tricky offseason. Oftentimes with successful teams, free agents get huge paydays elsewhere and their coaching staff gets looted.
The 49ers coaching staff is intact (thanks to Shanahan blocking an interview, which won’t be allowed in the future). The 49ers lost two key players this offseason and one semi-important piece: left tackle Joe Staley to retirement and DeForest Buckner to the Colts in a trade after the team decided to extend Arik Armstead on the defensive line. Wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders also left in free agency. But look at how the 49ers instantly replaced them all.
To replace Staley, they were able to trade for disgruntled former-Redskins tackle Trent Williams during the draft. Williams refused to play for the Redskins, so the 49ers made out on that deal. Williams didn’t play last year, but is a true beast of a left tackle.
They also took the first-round pick they received from the Colts in the Buckner trade and drafted DT Javon Kinlaw from South Carolina. They didn’t have to pay the veteran contract for Buckner and are able to pay much less on a rookie deal for Kinlaw and hopefully wind up with just as big a long-term stud on the interior.
Sanders was an extremely productive and efficient piece en route to the team’s Super Bowl run. But they took the 31st overall pick, along with a fourth- and fifth-round selection, and traded up to draft Arizona State wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. Aiyuk, a JUCO transfer, was a return specialist and a receiver who brings a lot of YAC ability to a team that thrives on YAC generating a lot of their passing yardage. Last year, 54.2% of Jimmy Garoppolo’s yardage came from yards after the catch, the highest rate for passers that took 50% of their team dropbacks.
The former three pieces, whose absences would have absolutely hurt the team, were instantly replaced thanks to aggressive moves in April. Unfortunately, the 49ers lost stud wide receiver Deebo Samuel to a Jones fracture in his left foot. These injuries are notoriously difficult to come back from. Teammate Trent Taylor had the same injury in 2019, and needed five surgeries (three of which were due to infection) and missed the entire season.
A starting skill set featuring tight end George Kittle, receivers Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk, fullback Kyle Juszczyk, and running back Raheem Mostert would have been very intriguing. We may not see it until later in the year. Now, we’ll have Kendrick Bourne replacing Samuel most likely, and the 49ers will be without two of their top three receivers from 2019.
Things on the other side of the ball won’t be easy. The 49ers played the NFL’s 13th-toughest schedule of offenses in 2019, but is projected to become the third-toughest in 2020. While the 49ers’ 2019 defense was outstanding, we somewhat built them into something they were not. Robert Saleh has done an outstanding job and this defense
has many studs but there were some shocking things about this defense.</p>
<p>In his first full NFL season, Jimmy Garoppolo was tasked with operating with efficiency over volume. Garoppolo ranked third in yards per pass attempt (8.4) while the 49ers as a team ranked eighth in the league in success rate passing (49%) and third in yards per passing play (7.4 yards), but also ranked 29th in passing plays per game (32.1). In games plus or minus seven points outside of the fourth quarter, San Francisco ranked 25th in the league in passing rate (41%) despite posting a 57% success rate and 8.7 yards per pass attempt in those situations. With that, there is a chicken or egg argument to be made if the overall offensive structure propelled the San Francisco team passing efficiency or that the 49ers should have dropped back and utilized the pass more than they actually did and will likely be forced to do moving forward when their game script naturally regresses in 2020.</p>
<p>With the passing game operating on a hyper-efficient level over volume, it is no surprise to see the 49ers receivers rank highly across the board in all areas of 2019. San Francisco’s wideouts ranked seventh in yards per target (9.2) and 12th in success rate (53%) while the tight ends ranked sixth (8.5 yards per target) and seventh (58% success rate) in the same areas. The biggest surprise is how efficient the team was throwing to running backs. Anchored by George Kittle and Deebo Samuel, the large moving part the 49ers passing game has in 2020 is losing veteran wideout Emmanuel Sanders, who they are replacing with first-round selection Brandon Aiyuk.</p>
<p>The 49ers run game was above the average league rate in 2019 and the team was not shy about leaning on that production. San Francisco ranked second in rushing attempt (31.1) and yardage (144.1 yards) per game. On those attempts, they ranked 16th in success rate (48%) rushing as a team while ranking eighth in yards per carry (4.6 yards) and eighth in EPA via their rushing offense. This was a collective effort as well, with three different backs rushing for over 500 yards while not one reached 800 yards on the ground. The highlight came from Raheem Mostert, who ranked fourth among all running backs in 2019 in success rate rushing (56%) and second among all backs in rate of runs to gain six or more yards (38%) on the season.</p>
<p>Do We Trust Any Of The Running Backs?
The 49ers backfield is one we want to target in totality. The team collectively ranked second in the league in touches (31.5) and yards from scrimmage (175.3) among all backfields. The problem for us is that everyone and anyone who touched the ball for them was effective, leaving us vulnerable at any moment for the backfield usage turning in another direction. The 49ers had four different running backs post a top-15 scoring week in PPR formats over the season while all of Raheem Mostert (952 yards), Tevin Coleman (724), and Matt Breida (743) chipped in with over 700 yards from scrimmage.
It was Mostert who carried the load to close the season. He tallied 792 total yards and 12 touchdowns over the final eight games of 2019. But he also had just nine receptions over that span and carries a terribly similar stigma surrounding him that fantasy gamers were faced with Damien Williams in drafts a year ago as mid-career, journeyman running back who popped with a big end of season run. We also saw the 49ers were still willing to pull the rug out on us at any moment, even with Mostert playing so well down the stretch. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the team once again showed that any back can step forward in the offense, with Coleman receiving a season-high 22 touches for 105 yards and two touchdowns while Mostert received 12 touches. The next week, Coleman injured his shoulder early in the game as he and Mostert were splitting snaps prior to Mostert going bananas the rest of the way in the NFC Championship game. With Jerick McKinnon swapping places for Breida and Jeffery Wilson still floating around the depth chart, the 49ers backfield could once again be a sum of parts that offers pockets of fantasy production for the individual components over one back being a locked-in wire-to-wire starting option.
Dealing with Deebo’s Injury
Outside of George Kittle there is a lot of uncertainty in the San Francisco passing game. We assumed that second-year wideout Deebo Samuel would make a jump after he ranked sixth in targets (84), fourth in receptions (57), and fourth in receiving yardage (802 yards) among all rookie wideouts, but an early-summer Jones Fracture injury has halted his ascension and places his early-season in doubt. This is the same injury that has impacted the post-return production for Sammy Watkins, Dez Bryant, Julian Edelman, and Greg Olsen amongst others in recent seasons. Samuel is still in play as a late-round dart, but now comes with a lot of risk on estimated return to the lineup, potential re-injury, and potential of a declined performance when he does return.
With Samuel on the mend, 2020 first-round rookie Brandon Aiyuk can receive a larger slice of the offense now. Aiyuk is strong after the catch (10.9 YAC in 2019) which goes along with what this offense was predicated on a year ago. No quarterback had a higher rate of his passing yardage come from yards after the catch than Jimmy Garoppolo a year ago (54.2%). While Aiyuk can have his role accelerated in the offense, second-year wideout Jalen Hurd has the profile of someone who can take on some of the unique assignments Samuel had in the offense. Samuel led all NFL wideouts in rushing yardage (159 yards) and touchdowns (three) in 2019. Hurd is a former college running back at Tennessee that transitioned to wide receiver at Baylor, with 637 collegiate rushing attempts for 2,844 yards and 23 touchdowns on the ground under his belt. Like Samuel, Hurd has a hard time avoiding injury, but fits the mold of filling the creative usage Samuel was receiving in the offense.</p>
<p>The 49ers had one of the league’s best defenses last season and kept most of the pieces together with one major offseason decision that had to be made —
the 49ers picked Arik Armstead for an extension and traded DeForest Buckner to the Indianapolis Colts. Armstead was the more versatile piece that can play on the edge and the interior. He could play the interior more with Bucker gone, where he was still a productive pass rusher. That could open up the edges for Nick Bosa and Dee Ford. Javon Kinlaw was a first-round pick who could also be the immediate replacement for Bucker inside.
Solomon Thomas hasn’t lived up to his draft status and is in the final year of his rookie deal. DJ Jones has emerged as a productive interior rusher as well. Julian Taylor could also provide depth as he has developed from a super athletic seventh-round pick in 2018.
With Bosa and Ford, the Niners have a dominant edge duo. There’s slightly less depth than last season with Buckner gone and Armstead potentially stretched more to the interior. Kentavius Street was a promising prospect who tore his ACL in pre-draft workouts and he appeared in four games last season. Kerry Hyder has also been a versatile inside/outside piece throughout his career and peaked with eight sacks in 2016.
Fred Warner has already turned into one of the best off-ball linebackers in the league with elite coverage and instincts. Many questioned the Kwon Alexander contract last offseason but he played well in coverage in the eight games he played in 2019. Dre Greenlaw also played incredibly well in the times he filled in at linebacker.
This might be the deepest group of corners in the league. Richard Sherman just had one of the best seasons of his career in his second year off his Achilles injury. K’Waun Williams and Emmanuel Moseley broke out as plus performers — Williams was 15th in Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap last season — and took over as the No. 2 and 3 corners. A 2019 decline from Ahkello Witherspoon could derail another group but the 49ers are so deep, they were able to work around it.
Like at other positions, the 49ers interchange some of their safeties and corners. Jaquiski Tartt has excelled in his deep safety role and Jimmie Ward has jumped between safety and corner, but has done well with both positions. He was re-signed to a three-year deal this offseason. Slot corner D.J. Reed also has some safety experience, though he tore a pectoral muscle in an offseason workout. Marcell Harris also played 40% of the defensive snaps last season and was a core special teamer.</p>
<p>The first thing was play-action. Of the 12 defenses in the postseason, the 49ers defense ranked dead last in success rate allowed (71%) when facing play-action during the playoffs. The 49ers ranked second-worst in play-action sensitivity in the playoffs, as offenses recorded 31% more success passing with play-action (71%) than without (40%).
In the regular season, the 49ers pass defense ranked first when opposing offenses did not use play-action. Success against the 49ers defense increased by 15% when opponents used play-action, which put the 49ers defense as the most sensitive team to play-action in the NFL in 2019. Against first quarter play-action, the 49ers ranked fifth-worst in performance and were the fifth most sensitive to it, while ranking first vs non-play-action passes.
Second, while the 49ers excelled at recording third down sacks (they had a 16% sack rate on third down), on early downs, it was just 6.3%.
And third, the 49ers were great limiting teams to enter the red zone, but when there, the 49ers defense was not good at all. The 49ers allowed a 61% red zone TD rate, which ranked 25th in the NFL. They allowed a 49% success rate in the red zone from Week 9 on, which ranked 25th and they allowed a 53% success rate to red zone passes, ranked 31st.
On 52 early down attempts in the 49ers red zone, opposing quarterbacks were not sacked once, and had a 15:1 TD:INT ratio. On 128 pass attempts inside the SF 40-yard line, opposing QBs were sacked just twice on early downs all season (1.6%), ranked 31st in the NFL. On 11 personnel passes in the red zone, the 49ers had the NFL’s worst pass defense. with a league-worst 53% success and 12 TDs on 45 plays with just one sack.
Like Garoppolo’s numbers, but for opposite reasons, those defensive numbers may surprise you and cut against your impression of this defense. And now they are playing a more difficult schedule of offenses in 2020.
Heading into the Super Bowl, the 49ers hadn’t trailed by more than seven points in the second half in 17 of 18 games this season. They trailed by 11 points for four minutes and 34 seconds in a 27-24 OT loss to Seattle in November. After delivering a memorable 2019 run that left them a 10-point fourth quarter lead in the Super Bowl, the 49ers face a slightly easier schedule than in 2019 based on opponent win totals. But it’s a schedule which is easy early before getting significantly more difficult.
In the first five weeks of the season, the 49ers play four teams projected to post a losing record. It’s the second-easiest schedule in the NFL. But from Week 6 onward, the 49ers are projected to face the NFL’s third-toughest schedule, playing nine of 11 games against teams forecast to have winning records in 2020.
That said, the NFL did significant favors for the 49ers with regard to when they play their games. The 49ers host three primetime games who are not West coast teams (Eagles Week 4, Packers Week 9, and Bills Week 13). These are brutal trips for those opposing teams and playing on the West coast in primetime is extremely difficult. Additionally, the 49ers get two home games following two primetime games, avoiding short road week games.
The toughest element of the 49ers schedule is that the run defenses they face will improve from the 19th toughest schedule to the third-toughest. It’s the toughest schedule of run defenses from Week 1 through 7.</p>
