<p>Writing the Jets chapter in the 2019 preview was frustrating. The aftermath of the 2018 Jets 4-12 season saw head coach Todd Bowles get fired. His newly appointed offensive
coordinator, Jeremy Bates, took over for John Morton and Bates was a disaster. I was
hoping this year’s chapter would be less frustrating. After all, Adam Gase was the new
head coach, and he was also the team’s playcaller. And the Jets went 7-9. It couldn’t be
worse than the 2018 Jets… could it The dismal 2018 Jets offense ranked 30th in EDSR and 29th in overall offensive .efficiency. It was a disaster. So in the offseason, they added dependable slot receiver .Jamison Crowder and Pro Bowl running back Le’Veon Bell.</p>
<p>water in sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>Whenever I see a team ranking 31st in third down conversion rate, as the 2019 Jets
offense did, the first place I look is average yardage to go on third down. In 2018, the Jets
averaged 7.5 yards to go on third downs, which ranked eighth-worst in the NFL. But in
2019, the Jets averaged a ridiculous 8.1 yards to go on third down. Dead last in the NFL. In the first half, they averaged an even worse 8.3 yards to go on third down. Also, dead last.
Clearly, the Jets’ 32nd rank in early down success not only resulted in few third downs skipped, it resulted in incredibly long yards to go on third down. So, what went wrong?</p>
<p>And yet the 2019 Jets offense ranked 32nd in EDSR and 31st in overall offensive .efficiency.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a team moving forward in Adam Gase’s first year. This was a wolf treading</p>
<p>If we flash back to 2018, I wrote about a significant problem that then-offensive coordinator Bates had with second downs. The Jets ran a ton on second and long, particularly after a Sam Darnold incompletion. They ran the ball the fourth-most often on second and 10+ yards to go in the first three quarters. These runs averaged just 13% success and gained only 3.3 YPC. Both were last in the NFL.
As it turns out, 2019 was like a bad version of Groundhog Day. It was the same movie, but with different characters. Sub out Bill Murray, act like you’re upgrading him, but instead we have to watch Jim Varney survive a day in Punxsutawney.
Instead of running fourth-most, the 2019 Jets ran third-most on 2nd and 10+ yards to go. These runs produced just 15% success and gained 3.0 YPC. They averaged -0.34 EPA/att. No, the upgrade from Isiah Crowell and Bilal Powell to Bell wasn’t worth anything on these plays.
The answer isn’t bringing in a better pedigree running back to run on 2nd and 10. It’s to stop running on 2nd and 10.
Such plays simply result in third and long, which the Jets couldn’t convert in 2018 or 2019, and likely won’t convert in 2020 either.
Overall the Jets ranked 29th in EDSR and 32nd in first half yards-to-go on third down.
It’s vital to fix the Jets’ performance on early downs, not just because it would keep them out of third and long, but because their 2019 results were so closely wed to EDSR performance. The Jets went 6-1 when winning the EDSR battle in 2019 and 1-8 when losing it.
Bringing in Le’Veon Bell didn’t do anything to help the Jets run game. What it did was eat up $9 million in cap space and give the Jets worse rushing efficiency than they had in 2018.
Bell averaged just 3.2 YPC and a 41% success rate, which ranked 68th. His explosiveness ranked 80th. He and the Jets ranked dead last in broken tackle rate. And this came against the NFL’s 10th-easiest schedule of run defenses last year.
But it’s about to get worse for the Jets. Bell’s 2020 cap hit nearly doubles to $15.5 million. It’s the NFL’s highest running back cap hit, and No. 2 isn’t close. David Johnson’s cap hit is at $11 million.
The only two running backs hitting the cap for over $11 million in 2020 averaged 3.2 YPC and 3.7 YPC last year and scored a combined five touchdowns in 28 games.
The good news is, the schedule of opposing run defenses is about to lighten up, as I forecast the Jets will play the third-easiest schedule of opposing run defenses in 2019. The Jets won’t ever get enough efficiency out of Bell to justify his cap hit, but the reality is no running back will deliver that much efficiency. Still, the Jets must figure out a way to use him to maximize his efficiency as much as possible. Their 2019 offensive line was the second-most injured group in the NFL last year, so player health is likely to improve in 2020. And perhaps such continuity would improve Bell’s efficiency.
But more than anything, the Jets seemed like they needed a little more dabbling on the offensive end. Two examples:
In the game’s first three quarters, the Jets used 69% 11 personnel. The NFL average was 58%. Their usage rate was 12% above average, and seventh-highest in the NFL. However, their efficiency from 11 personnel was terrible.
The Jets averaged -0.18 EPA/att from 11 personnel in the first three quarters, the second-worst in the NFL. They recorded 6.5 YPA, a 12:12 TD:INT ratio, and took a sack on 10% of dropbacks. All of these were bottom five in the NFL. Yet they stayed in 11 at one of the highest rates in the NFL.</p>
<p>This was one of the exact issues I had with Gase when in Miami. There was always far too much 11 personnel which wasn’t productive. When something isn’t working, try switching it up. Experiment. Figure out another way to coax efficiency out of the offense.
Out of all the teams in the NFL last year, only six used fewer unique lineups on offense than the Jets. When something isn’t working and isn’t efficient, the least likely way a team will improve is to continue doing it repeatedly.
Some coaches may believe the repetition to be beneficial and eventually, the team will turn the corner and perfect things. But if you’re putting too limited a catalog on tape, defenses know exactly what to expect. You may be slightly better, but defenses can anticipate what’s coming from the lack of diversity. And your efficiency is unlikely to improve.
Another issue I had with the Jets offense was predictability. If you flip to the Success by Play Type and Primary Personnel Groupings graphic in this chapter and review the Jets performance when rushing from 12 or 21 personnel, you’ll notice it was terrible. In part, that was because of how predictable the Jets were based on personnel grouping.
When they were in 12 personnel, they ran the ball 70% of the time, third-most often in the NFL. The NFL average was 53% run from 12 personnel. These predictable runs averaged 2.4 YPC, a 34% success rate, and -0.28 EPA/att.
It should not surprise that the two teams that ran even more often when in 12 personnel than the Jets also had terrible production (Bears and Redskins).
In 13 personnel, the Jets ran the ball 84% of the time, also third-most often (NFL average 64% run). These predictable runs averaged 2.8 YPC, a 33% success rate, and -0.16 EPA/att.
In 22 personnel, they ran the ball 93% of the time, second-most often (NFL average 80% run). These predictable runs averaged 0.4 YPC, a 21% success rate, and -0.30 EPA/att.
When tight end Trevon Wesco was on the field with Daniel Brown, the Jets ran the ball on 83 of 102 plays (81%). When Wesco was on the field without wide receiver Robby Anderson, it was a run 88% of the time.
The Jets were not great running out of 11 personnel either, but were far worse running out of heavy sets simply because they would run so often, defenses played run and the Jets never made them pay.
Another thing that was very odd for Gase was his usage of shotgun for Darnold. With 3+ WRs on the field, it was 88% shotgun, which was in line with the NFL average. But from 12 or 13 personnel, while the NFL average was 55% shotgun, Gase had Darnold under center 73% of the time. The most in the NFL.
Ironically, where Darnold crushed in 2018 from 12 or 13 personnel was in shotgun. At that time, Jeremy Bates called 50% shotgun, 50% under center, and exactly 50 dropbacks from each. Splits:
- Under center: 6.0 YPA, 47% success, 68.1 rating - In shotgun: 8.8 YPA, 52% success, 123.5 rating
Therefore, not surprisingly, where Darnold crushed it in 2019 was from 12 or 13 when in shotgun, not under center. Splits:
- Under center: 7.0 YPA, 43% success, 0.09 EPA/att, 74.9 rating - In shotgun: 12.0 YPA, 71% success, 0.51 EPA/att, 156.3 rating
Gase didn’t appear to notice the massive splits for Darnold in 2018, when he performed so much better in shotgun heavy sets. And he didn’t appear to notice via self-scout the massive splits when he performed the same exact way. Instead, the Jets continued to put Darnold under center when passing from heavy sets all season long.
Another thing that Gase didn’t help was Darnold’s expected completion rate. Using player tracking, we can determine completion probability by looking at based on numerous factors such as receiver separation from the nearest defender, where the receiver is on the field, and the separation the passer had at the time of throw from the nearest pass rusher. Darnold ranked 38 of 39 QBs in 2018… and 36 of 39 QBs in 2019. They need to work more on getting better +EV targets to increase the overall efficiency of this passing offense.
What Gase was able to do was to improve Darnold on 3-step drops. In 2018, Darnold was at 6.2 YPA, 41% success, and a terrible -0.25 EPA/att. In 2019, Gase improved that to 7.4 YPA, 49% success, and 0.08 EPA/att. But nearly 25% of Darnold’s attempts were 0/1 step drops and on these, he had just 4.9 YPA, 45% success, and -0.09 EPA/att. This was much worse than Darnold’s performance here in 2018. They need to harvest more efficiency on these quick throws in 2020.
Some good news for Jets fans is that in 2019, they ranked 31st in fumble luck and 30th in field goal luck. These two factors typically regress and that should benefit the Jets in 2020. But bad news relates to the schedule.
Last summer I forecasted the Jets would play the NFL’s second-easiest schedule. I was close, as they played the fifth-easiest schedule. But in 2020, they will face the NFL’s third-toughest schedule. It’s easily the biggest shift from easy to hard for any team in the NFL. The schedule gets tough on Sam Darnold, especially. The 2019 Jets played eight games against top-half pass defenses and went 2-6 in those games. They played seven games against bottom-10 pass defenses and went 5-2. But in 2020 they play 10 games against top-half pass defenses and only four games against bottom-10 pass defenses. Overall, I forecast the Jets to face the fourth-toughest schedule of pass defenses. The other story is the Jets pass defense will be in for a much tougher schedule as well. In 2019 they faced just five pass offenses that ranked in the top half of the NFL. In 2020, I project they will face at least eight. The Jets will receive one big benefit of facing the Broncos at home on a Thursday, which forces a team from two time zones West to travel East on a short week. They also have the benefit of hosting the Patriots on a Monday night game and playing the Dolphins before and right out of a bye.</p>
<p>With Sam Darnold diagnosed with early-season mononucleosis and Luke Falk playing essentially three full games, the Jets closed the season ranked 30th in the league in success rate passing (40%) and 32nd in EPA through the air in 2019. Darnold did improve in some areas over his rookie season, increasing his completion rate (61.9%), touchdown rate (4.3%), and decreasing his interception rate (2.9%) in year two. But unfortunately, all of those marks were below the league watermark while Darnold’s 6.9 yards per pass attempt ranked 29th in the league. 2020 is a big season for Darnold to take a true stride forward. Darnold enters his third season still as one of the youngest quarterbacks in the league, turning only 23 years old this June. In context, expected No. 1 overall draft pick Joe Burrow turned 23 years old this past December.</p>
<p>New York wide receivers ranked 22nd in yards per target (7.4 yards) and 29th in success rate in 2019. Jets wideouts were in the back half of the league with 12.1 receptions (17th) for 150.8 receiving yards (21st) per game while combining for 12 touchdowns (24th). The team moved on from Robby Anderson via free agency, but did select rookie Denzel Mims in the second round of the draft and signed Breshad Perriman in free agency. The Jets ranked 13th in yards per attempt (7.4 yards) and 12th in success rate targeting tight ends, but targeted the position just 11% of the time (29th). Getting Chris Herndon back in year three should raise that volume. Using their backs out of the backfield was a major issue, ranking 20th in yards per attempt.</p>
<p>It is arguable that the Jets had the worst rushing game in the NFL last season. The team ranked 31st in rushing success rate (40%), 31st in yards per rush (3.3 yards), 32nd in yards above success rate, and 31st in EPA on the ground. This after signing free agent Le’Veon Bell to a lucrative contract during the offseason. Bell ranked 55-of-66 backs with 50 or more carries in success rate (41%) on the ground while explosive runs were few and far between. Just 12 of Bell’s 245 carries gained 10 or more yards (4.9%) while Bell was one of just two backs with at least 100 carries (Peyton Barber being the other) to fail to have a run of at least 20 yards on the season. This offseason, the team added Frank Gore and La’Mical Perine to join Bell in the backfield.</p>
<p>Is there anything to be excited about on the Jets Offense in 2020?
The biggest thing that the Jets had to address this offseason was their offensive line. Sam Darnold was under pressure on a league-high 42.1% of dropbacks in 2019. Under pressure, he averaged just 4.6 yards per pass attempt (26th out of 28 qualifiers) while he averaged 8.2 Y/A while kept clean, which ranked 11th from the same group of passers. That +3.6 Y/A difference between being clean versus pressure was the largest such discrepancy among passers in the league last year. Darold will still only be 23 years old this upcoming season, but remains a QB2 and streaming option for fantasy purposes.
Le’Veon Bell set career-lows in nearly every major category in his first season with the Jets. His patient rushing style was a poor fit for the Jets porous offensive line, which ranked last in yards before contact (0.71) per carry for their running backs as Bell mustered just 3.2 yards per carry and no runs of 20-plus yards on the entire season. Bell also had no scoring juice, reaching the end zone just four times on 311 touches. On the positive end, Bell was still a workhorse, handling 311 touches overall (eighth in the league) and 72.3% of the backfield touches, which also ranked eighth among running backs. The additions of a 37-year-old and fourth-round rookie La’Mical Perine do not pose significant threats to that workload once again remaining high in 2020.
There are still improvements to be made up front, but adding Conner McGovern and first-round tackle Mekhi Becton are upgrades over what the Jets had at those positions a year ago.
In the receiving game, Jamison Crowder led the team in receptions (78), receiving yards (833), and touchdowns (six) in his first season with the team. Second-round draft pick Denzel Mims led the country with 30.3% of his catches coming in contested catch situations in 2019, which can be perceived as a strength in winning one-on-one battles while potentially a negative if he struggles to create separation. Signing Breshad Perriman aids the development of Mims while filling the void left behind by Robby Anderson, Perriman set career highs in targets (69), receptions (36), receiving yards (645), and touchdowns (six). What got Perriman a new contract was the way he finished the season, catching 25-of-37 targets for 506 yards (20.2 yards per catch) and five touchdowns over his final five games of the season, while Chris Godwin and Mike Evans dealt with end of season injuries.
For fantasy, Crowder is a fine FLEX option in PPR formats, while Perriman offers volatility and Mims a lottery ticket that could potentially become the lead wide receiver at some point during his rookie season.
Perhaps the most intriguing Jets offensive player is Chris Herndon. Herndon was suspended for the opening four weeks of the season and then managed to play just 18 snaps afterwards as he dealt with hamstring issues. A post-hype breakout is still on the table after a 39-502-4 rookie season in 2019 in which he averaged 9.0 yards per target.</p>
<p>Quinnen Williams didn’t live up to expectations as the No. 3 overall pick last season with just six quarterback hits but was still a good run defender. Steve McLendon and Folorunso Fatukasi were also great against the run. There is a deep group of interior defenders that could use a little more pass rush outside of a Williams improvement.
Jordan Jenkins re-signed for one year after not getting a better deal as a free agent. He was the Jets’ best edge rusher last season, which probably tells you enough about this edge group. Jenkins and Tarrell Basham had similar pressure rates, but Jenkins converted a much higher rate into sacks.
Behind them, there’s not much. The Jets did rank 12th as a team in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate, but were 22nd in pressure rate per SIS and relied heavily on blitzing, 30% which tied for the eighth-highest rate in the league in 2019. Jabari Zuniga was drafted in the third round and Memphis linebacker Bryce Huff, who led the NCAA in pressures, was brought in as a UDFA.
The Jets spent a lot of money to bring in C.J. Moseley last season but the former Raven lasted just two games before his year ended. Avery Williamson was also lost for the season before it began with a torn ACL in August. The injuries left the Jets with a hole that wasn’t filled well by a rotating cast. Neville Hewitt, Blake Cashman, and James Burgess were good blitzers but failed to hold up with other responsibilities.
When Pierre Desir is signed to potentially be the team’s No. 1 corner, there’s a depth and talent issue. Desir struggled a bit with the Colts last season and was released just a year into a three-year deal with Indianapolis. Brian Poole was one of the league’s best nickel corners last season and was a bargain to bring back on a one-year deal in free agency. After those two, whew. Nate Hairston was one of the most targeted corners on a per snap basis last season and there was good reason. Fifth-round pick Bryce Hall had 21 passes defensed in 2018 before an injury took some effectiveness in 2019 but a fully healthy Hall could be the best corner on this team.
Jamal Adams is a do-it-all safety and it appears he wants to do-it-all somewhere else. Last season, Adams spent time as the team’s best safety, linebacker, and pass rusher. The Jets have been in no rush to get an extension done and Adams’s frustrations with the franchise have not been kept secret. Marcus Maye has also been a good safety opposite Adams. Ashtyn Davis is an athletic rangey safety drafted in the third round.</p>
