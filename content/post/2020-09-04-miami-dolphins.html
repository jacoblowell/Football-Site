<p>The tank is over.
Miami signed 12 players in free agency for a total of $237 million, the most of any team. How much is that, really? The team spending the second-most was essentially $100 million less (the Lions at $138 million).
How does what the Dolphins spent in 2020 free agency compare to the highest spending team over the last ten years?
2020: $237 million – Dolphins 2019: $226 million – Jets 2018: $194 million – Jets 2017: $177 million – Jaguars 2016: $225 million – Jaguars 2015: $182 million – Jets 2014: $147 million – Bucs 2013: $159 million – Dolphins 2012: $162 million – Bucs 2011: $149 million – Panthers
The salary cap has risen from $120 million in 2011 to $198 million in 2020, or approximately $7.8 million per year. The Jaguars’ spend in 2016 was extraordinarily large (landed Malik Jackson, Kelvin Beachum, Tashaun Gipson, and Chris Ivory, among others). But net overall, no team has spent more on free agents in the history of the NFL than did the 2020 Dolphins.
They paid an average of nearly $20 million per player ($19.8 million), also the most in the NFL.</p>
<p>How does that compare to Miami’s 2019’s offseason? Prior to 2019, the Dolphins signed 15 players, but for a combined $33.4 million, the third-least of any team. They spent over $200 million more this offseason.
The 2020 Dolphins signed five players whose average salary is $7.5 million or higher.
The 2019 Dolphins signed zero players whose average salary was $6.0 million or higher.
But it even goes beyond that. The 2018 Dolphins signed just one player with an AAV over $7.5 million (Albert Wilson). As did the 2017 Dolphins (Jay Cutler). The 2016 Dolphins signed zero. The 2015 Dolphins signed one (Ndamukong Suh). As did the 2014 Dolphins (Branden Albert). As did the 2013 Dolphins (Mike Wallace). What did that exercise show?
The 2020 Dolphins signed as many players with an average salary of $7.5 million as they did in the prior seven years combined. That’s remarkable.
Miami gave cornerback Byron Jones the most lucrative contract of any free agent this offseason. Five years, $82.5 million. No team spent more on a single player.
In addition, the Dolphins gave former Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy $51 million, which was the seventh-highest in the entire 2020 free agent class. They also added EDGE Shaq Lawson (from Buffalo) for $30 million, guard Ereck Flowers (from Washington), and EDGE Emmanuel Ogbah (from Kansas City).
In 2019, only seven defenses spent less cap money on their defense than Miami’s $63.7 million. To hit that mark, they purged several players, including Cameron Wake, who signed with the Titans for $23 million. They also signed a ton of defensive players to one-year deals for cheap. Guys like Robert Nkemdiche, Adolphus Washington, Tyler Patmon, and Terrance Smith. Each signed for one year only at less than $1 million. But three of the four were released prior to the season, and Nkemdiche played only 16 defensive snaps before he was released.
Their best young defensive player was 2018 first-rounder Minkah Fitzpatrick (only one year of experience heading into 2019), but he made just two starts for the Dolphins and was then traded to the Steelers for a first-round pick.
What Miami effectively did defensively was start the NFL’s least experienced unit. Looking at the 2019 Dolphins defensive snaps, they played the least experienced roster in the NFL. The average age per snap was 25.1 years old. For comparison, the Patriots’ defense – Brian Flores’s old team and one of the best defenses in the NFL – had the oldest defense with an average age of 28.2 years.
Miami started (not just played in games but actually started) 10 rookies last year on defense (53 total games started between the 10). They also saw 33 games started by five players with just one year of experience.</p>
<p>I’ll introduce a concept to show the point, as suggesting a snap weighted age of 25 is not the easiest concept to grasp.</p>
<p>On a team, 16 games started by players equals one full-season starter equivalent. So 53 games started by rookies equates to 3.3 full-season starter equivalents. And we know that the defense can only have a total of 11 full-season starter equivalents. Splitting by age, the 2019 Dolphins had:
Rookies: 3.3 full-season starter equivalents One-year exp: 2.1 full-season starter equivalents Two-years exp: 3.2 full-season starter equivalents 3+ years exp: 2.4 full-season starter equivalents
That’s the experience of their 11 starters in 2019. Super, super young. Of the seven players to start 10+ games, only one had more than two years of experience. These were young guys, like rookies first-round pick Christian Wilkins and undrafted free agent Nik Needham.
Having established the pure youth, let’s look at the quality of starters doing the same exercise as above to determine, of the 11 full-season starters, what their make-up was by draft round:
Undrafted: 2.5 full-season starter equivalents Fifth-seventh round: 3.0 full-season starter equivalents Third-fourth round: 1.9 full-season starter equivalents Second round: 2.0 full-season starter equivalents
First round: 1.6 full-season starter equivalents
Only 8.5 out of 11 spots were players actually drafted. Exactly half the defense (5.5 spots) were players drafted in the fifth to seventh rounds or undrafted, and the other half of the defense was drafted in the first four rounds. This was a defense lacking in talent.</p>
<p>Having established the pure youth and poor talent, the final straw was this defense saw its starters rotated to a tremendous extent. They clocked in as the third-most injured defense, but some of these injuries may have been putting guys down strategically.
It was impossible to see any continuity or develop chemistry. A defense has 11 starters. It’s virtually impossible that all 11 make 16 starts. But the Dolphins had a total of 28 players make starts on defense.
So between youth, talent, and the disjointedness of the defense, it was bound to be bad. And it was. Despite playing the fourth-easiest schedule of opposing offenses, the defense was predictably terrible, ranking 32nd in EDSR, 32nd in overall efficiency, and 32nd in most other critical metrics.
It had to be a real downer for new head coach Brian Flores. But he bought into the plan. It was a tank from the personnel department, specifically on his side of the ball. There wasn’t much he could do about it on the field. When you’re allowing offenses like the Browns, Giants, Bengals, and Bills to put up over 30 points, you know it has to be frustrating, but the good news is the tank ended quickly.
The first thing we must realize is, this defense is going to be substantially different in 2020. They brought in veterans in free agency. They won’t be tanking because of youth, bad talent, or (barring injury) disjointedness.
Just take a look at the four big priced defensive free agents they added and where they were drafted:
First round: Byron Jones, Shaq Lawson
Second round: Kyle Van Noy, Emmanuel Ogbah
These are pedigree players with four, five, and six years of experience. The two tables we looked at and compared full-season starter equivalents by years of experience and by draft round? Blow both of them out of the water with these four new starters, who bring experience and were highly drafted.
And then there is the 2020 draft. The Dolphins drafted defensive players in the first three rounds of the draft, snagging cornerback Noah Igbinoghene, defensive tackle Raekwon Davis, and safety Brandon Jones.
Time will tell how much these players see the field in 2020, but with these three picks plus the top four defensive free agents, all seven of these defensive players were drafted in the first three rounds. Add to that starting cornerback Xavien Howard (second round), Christian Wilkins (first round), linebacker Raekwon McMillian (second round), cornerback Eric Rowe (second round), and linebacker Jerome Baker (third round), you suddenly go from a defense that was young, with a ton of round 5+ or undrafted starters to a veteran unit with a thick influence of highly touted and drafted players.
And the good news is the 2020 Dolphins defense still gets to play an easy schedule of offenses, that is made even easier without Tom Brady twice a year. Miami will face the tenth-easiest schedule of opposing offenses, including the eighth-easiest schedule of passing offenses and the sixth-easiest schedule of opposing run offenses.
The AFC East is laden with incredible defenses and given this virtual offseason, I think it will be difficult for this group to make a one-year jump to be in that conversation. But they’ll be noticeably better than 2019 and are well on their way to providing the offense with the support they’ll need by 2021.
The rest of the 2020 draft for the Dolphins was fascinating. The Dolphins entered with the most draft picks and the most draft capital (value of picks in possession). They held pat in rounds 1-3, but turned eight late-round picks into five, by trading up the board, and added a 2021 pick in the process.
They ended near even in total value, but tried to reduce late-round picks. The Dolphins left the 2020 draft with three fewer picks then they entered. No other team was down more than two picks.
We don’t know what Chris Grier was thinking in March 2019. But if he was thinking like most general managers without a long-term quarterback, he was thinking: “I really hope we’re in position to land Tua Tagovailoa in the 2020 draft.” Everyone assumed at the time that position was No. 1 overall. But then Tua was injured. And Joe Burrow exploded. We all know every GM has a different taste. And it’s hard to imagine, with the way the season ended, that if the Dolphins had the first overall pick they would have taken Tua over Burrow at that spot. More than likely, if they really wanted Tua, they would have traded down a few picks. Regardless, imagine for a moment that Tua was the guy Grier wanted in March 2019 AND in March 2020 — a plan that played out perfectly for Miami.
Many people thought the Dolphins were making a mistake by winning a few games last season. After going 0-7 to start the year, the Dolphins went 5-4 to The Dolphins were at the bottom of the league in nearly every passing category in 2019. They ranked 29th in success rate (42%), 20th in EPA, 22nd in yards per attempt (6.7), and tied in allowing a league-high 58 sacks. While Ryan Fitzpatrick was better than Josh Rosen, the 37-year-old passer was not going to be the answer for Miami. Miami used the No. 5 overall pick in this year’s draft to select Tua Tagovailoa. At almost a year and a half younger than the No. 1 selection in the draft in Joe Burrow, Tagovailoa ranks in the 99th percentile in career yards per attempt (10.9) and TD/INT ratio (7.9:1) among all quarterbacks invited to the combine since 2000. The Dolphins will likely slow play Tua’s start given his hip injury and Fitzpatrick in place to bridge the gap, but once Tagovailoa is ready and cleared to dress, he should find the field quickly.</p>
<p>The Dolphins wide receivers ranked 16th in success rate (51%) and 20th in yards per target (7.6) in 2019, but did have some positives. Miami got a massive breakout from former 2015 first-round pick DeVante Parker (72-1,202-9) while undrafted rookie Preston Williams led the Dolphins in targets (60), receptions (32), and receiving yardage (428) through the opening eight games of the season. Miami tight ends ranked 28th in yards per target (6.3) and 27th in success rate (45%), but second-year tight end Mike Gesicki finished the season with improved production. After a 15-153-0 line through seven games, Gesicki bounced back with a 36-417-5 line to close the season over the final nine weeks.</p>
<p>No team got less production from its backfield in 2019 than the Dolphins. Ranking 32nd in success rate rushing (39%), Miami backs collectively ranked dead last in touches (22.9) and yards from scrimmage (89.4) per game while averaging 3.9 yards per touch and scoring five total touchdowns. Ryan Fitzpatrick actually led the team with 243 rushing yards and their top back in yardage was Mark Walton with 201 yards on the ground. The Dolphins made an effort to reshape nearly the entire rushing unit. Jordan Howard and Matt Breida were added to the backfield while offensive linemen Austin Jackson and Robert Hunt were drafted in the top-40 picks this spring. Ereck Flowers and Ted Karras were added via free agency. Miami should be able to at least generate more production from their backfield than they did a year ago.</p>
<p>Can we buy DeVante Parker’s 2019 breakout?
After four years of perpetually offseason hype and inevitable end-of-season disappointment, DeVante Parker finally showcased the WR1 upside many believed he had all along. Parker broke out with 1,202 yards and nine touchdowns in 2019 after a combined 979 yards receiving and two touchdowns over the 2017-2018 seasons. The loss of Preston Williams played a big role for Parker. He averaged 9.5 targets and 19.3 PPR points per game in the eight weeks after Williams was lost for the season after averaging 6.5 targets and 11.5 points per game prior. Ryan Fitzpatrick’s hyper-aggressive nature also elevated the downfield receiver. Parker ranked third in the NFL in targets of 20-plus yards downfield (17) while tied for the league lead in receptions (11) and led all wideouts in touchdowns (four) on those targets over the final eight weeks of the season. While Parker’s splits with and without Williams active are a concern, getting paired with the potential fit of a rookie passer in Tagovailoa could also give pause for a followup in 2020.
Parker did put some high points on his resume against high-end corners that shut nearly everyone else down a year ago, which suggests he did take a step forward. Parker’s explosion down the stretch included huge games against Buffalo (7-135-0), catching 5-of-5 targets for 80 yards in coverage of Tre’Davious White in that game, and New England (8-137-0) while catching 7-of-9 targets for 119 yards in coverage of Stephon Gilmore.
Is Mike Gesicki the late-round tight end to target?
Like Parker, Mike Gesicki’s season took a big swing after the injury to Preston Williams. After a 15-153-0 line through seven games, Mike Gesicki bounced back with a 36-417-5 to close the season over the final nine weeks. Gesicki averaged 7.3 targets per game (18.0% of the team targets) after Williams was injured compared to 3.9 targets (11.0% of the team share) per game prior. Gesicki reached 35 receiving yards in just three of those eight games without Williams active, but found the end zone five times to elevate his stock. Over that same span, Gesicki was tied for the league lead among tight ends in targets 20-plus yards downfield (10) and ranked second in both receptions (five) and touchdowns (two) on those targets.
For the season, Gesicki ran a league-high 71.1% of his routes from the slot for all tight ends, which played a large part in him ranking third at the position in routes run (alongside Miami playing catch-up on the scoreboard consistently). He also was second among all tight ends in average depth of target (11.6 yards). A 99th percentile SPARQ score athlete, Gesicki runs into similar questions surrounding Williams returning to the lineup and Tagovailoa inevitably taking over, but offers upside in the latter portion of drafts for those that miss out on the early tiers of tight ends.</p>
<p>The Dolphins were a low-talent, high-effort team under Brian Flores in 2019 but went out and acquired more top-end talent through free agency and the draft.
Christian Wilkins was a first-round pick last season and was a decent disruptor up the middle. Among 97 defensive tackles with at least 100 pass rush snaps, Wilkins ranked 16th in pressure rate last season per SIS. Those pressures weren’t converted into sacks, but that’s something that can regress from year-to-year. Davon Godchaux was the nose tackle and he also found his way into the backfield with seven quarterback hits (though he ranked 67th in pressure rate). Depth at the position is a question but Raekwon Davis was drafted in the second round and Jason Strowbridge was drafted in the fifth.
If Miami is going run with the “positionless” thing on defense, they’re going all-in with this edge group. Charles Harris never came close to living up to his first-round status — he had 3.5 sacks through three seasons — and he was shipped to the Falcons for a 2021 seventh-round pick after the draft. In free agency, the Dolphins went hard at the edge and added Shaq Lawson, Emmanuel Ogbah, and Kyle Van Noy. Van Noy is listed as an edge but he’s a versatile player who can fill many roles on the defense. Fifth-round pick Curtis Weaver had one of the highest pressure rates in this draft class and added 19.5 tackles for loss in his final season at Boise State.
After being a starter in 2017 and 2018, Elandon Roberts lost his role and was downgraded to just 20% of the New England defensive snaps last season. He’s likely to jump back into a starter role for the Dolphins. Raekwon McMillan has been an old school run-stuffing linebacker with little in the way of coverage ability. Jerome Baker has taken most of the coverage responsibility as an athletic linebacker who can move into the slot when needed.
There’s some solid depth here with Kamu Grugier-Hill, who was a below-average starter but a fine fill-in, and Andrew Van Ginkel who was a heavy blitzer both in college and during his rookie season (though to little success last year).
Miami made the effort to improve its outside coverage this offseason and brought in Byron Jones. Paired with Xavien Howard, who missed most of last season with a knee injury, the Dolphins have one of the better outside corner duos in the league. There’s some question of the nickel corner, though. Rookie undrafted free agent Nik Needham filled in admirably last season and spent some time in the slot. That role could also go to Bobby McCain who had been a nickel corner before playing free safety for the Dolphins last season. Though, McCain is more likely to stay at safety after Miami took Noah Igbinoghene in the first round.</p>
<p>close the season. All five of their wins were by just one score. And as a result, they lost out on the first overall pick. But if they always wanted Tua rather than Burrow, it was irrelevant. In that scenario, the Dolphins got their quarterback and didn’t have to make a single move to get him. A dream scenario.
I said before the draft, if you’re planning to draft Tua, you had better not neglect your offensive line. Thanks to a bevy of draft capital, the Dolphins not only landed Tua but two top-40 offensive linemen (Austin Jackson and Robert Hunt). They brought in a few offensive linemen in free agency as well.
Miami went -35 in sack margin in 2019 and allowed 58 sacks. They must do a better job protecting Tua. With the abbreviated offseason, it may be even more difficult for offensive lines to gel. Miami is returning only three starters along the line and have the second-least amount of salary cap dedicated to the offensive line.
As much as I want to see Tua get a shot, not only is the schedule not suited for him, this line won’t be able to protect him. I think it’s a long shot to believe it’s a good decision to start Tua in Week 1. I believe we shouldn’t see him for at least a month, if not longer. Ryan Fitzpatrick proved with a terrible defense and poor surrounding talent, he could keep things interesting offensively. Once Tua is comfortable with the offense and the line has gelled as much as possible, that’s when he should make his first start.
In 2020 the Dolphins’ offense faces the NFL’s toughest schedule of total defenses and the toughest schedule of pass defenses. It starts right out of the gate, with games against two top-5 pass defenses from 2019, the Patriots and Bills.
From a scheduling perspective, it might make the most sense to start Tua in Week 7 after a stay on the West coast between road games in San Francisco and Denver. But the Chargers pass defense, with the return of Derwin James, won’t be easy, nor will be facing the top-10 Rams pass defense the very next week.
Additionally, the Dolphins’ start to the season features four teams projected to win 9+ games and a road Thursday night game. They close the season with back-to-back road games and have to travel to play in Buffalo Week 17.
The Dolphins won’t be tanking in 2020. But the season won’t be easy. The little things I’ll be watching for are how Tua looks and develops, how the new-look defense performs, and how the first year under offensive coordinator Chan Gailey looks.
Miami has a lot to look forward to beyond 2020. While they made 11 draft picks in 2020, the 2021 Dolphins are set to make another splash with this draft capital:
Round 1 — 2 picks (own, Texans) Round 2 — 2 picks (own, Texans) Round 3 — 1 pick (own)
Round 4 — 1 pick (own)
Round 5 — 1 pick (own)
Round 6 — 2 picks (Steelers, Seahawks) Round 7 — 1 pick (Falcons)
Having the Texans’ picks could be better in 2021 then the last several years, because for the first time since 2014, oddsmakers are projecting the Texans to have a losing season (7.5 wins).</p>
