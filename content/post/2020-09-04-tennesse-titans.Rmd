The anti-Jeff Fisher Titans have now recorded 9-7 records for four straight seasons. In
two of those seasons, they made the playoffs. When there, they’ve proved to be
dangerous opponents, beating strong pedigreed teams of the Chiefs, Ravens, and
Patriots and nearly upsetting the eventual Super Bowl champion 2020 Chiefs.

While the 2019 Titans won just as many games as the 2018, 2017, and 2016 Titans,
teams should not be defined just by the old Parcellsism “you are what your record says .you are”.
They were substantially better than their 2018 team. They also were brave. enough” to lead the team to three-straight 9-7 records are not going to risk bringing in a
                                    
Brave to acquire Ryan Tannehill last offseason despite exercising Marcus Mariota’s .

fifth-year option for the 2019 season, which came with a $20.9 million cap number. Most .teams that draft a quarterback in the first few picks in the draft, and see him do “good

backup that may disrupt the starter.

Most teams think “it will look like we made a mistake in the draft, so let’s clutch our
drafted quarterback until he produces a losing record.” The Titans didn’t submit to popular convention or worry about what the media thought about bringing in Tannehill. And they were brave enough to swap out Marcus Mariota to see what Tannehill had left in the tank after just six games in the season.
The 2019 Titans are an example of the importance of good quarterback play, the value of cutting ties when it’s time, and the benefit of not overpaying a middling quarterback just because you drafted him high.

If general manager Jon Robinson never acquired Ryan Tannehill, Mike Vrabel never has a chance to start him. If Mike Vrabel never starts Tannehill, the Titans don’t make the playoffs. If the Titans don’t make the playoffs, we never see the thrilling upset postseason wins in New England, in Baltimore, and an epic game in Kansas City.
But let’s also take a moment to appreciate offensive coordinator Arthur Smith.
So much in the NFL is interdependent, and try as we might to isolate certain aspects to assign responsibility or ownership, it’s challenging and imperfect... even at the most important position in the NFL, the quarterback.

Put Ryan Tannehill on the 2019 Titans but bring along his 2018 playcaller, Adam Gase. This team isn’t in the AFC Championship. But the same is true if you left Tannehill on the Dolphins for the 2019 season but gave him Arthur Smith.
The 2019 Titans absolutely benefitted from the balanced roster, the ability to run the ball, some solid downfield threats, and strong tight end options.
But what turned this team into a feared and worthy opponent was Arthur Smith’s development as a play designer and playcaller.
In 2018, his first year in the position, Smith used pre-snap motion ahead of 60% of snaps the first three quarters of the game, ranking second-highest in the NFL. But there wasn’t a noticeable bump in production. And he only used play-action on early downs at a league-average rate.
Smith made significant advances in the offseason to get more out of his pre-snap motion packages, and it had nothing to do with Ryan Tannehill.
Arthur Smith used pre-snap motion at the NFL’s third-highest rate in Weeks 1-6 with Marcus Mariota at the helm. And it made a substantial impact.
Mariota-led passing splits with pre-snap motion quarters 1-3:
• With PSM: 8.4 YPA, 42% success, -0.03 EPA/att, 104 rating • W/O PSM: 6.0 YPA, 24% success, -0.34 EPA/att, 64 rating
Runs also saw significant efficiency boost with pre-snap motion:
• With PSM: 4.2 YPC, 51% success, 0.07 EPA/att • W/O PSM: 3.8 YPC, 38% success, -0.15 EPA/att
Smith continued usage of pre-snap motion with Ryan Tannehill under center, even though the dividends weren’t as noteworthy since the Tannehill was great even without the motion:
With PSM: 9.0 YPA, 58% success, 0.10 EPA/att, 120 rating
W/O PSM: 8.8 YPA, 48% success, 0.10 EPA/att, 104 rating
Smith slightly dropped the usage of PSM ahead of run plays, as the offense was generating solid games even in its absence:
• With PSM: 5.8 YPC, 57% success, 0.10 EPA/att • W/O PSM: 6.1 YPC, 57% success, 0.18 EPA/att
Bottom line – the Titans increased their pre-snap motion usage by just over 1% in 2019 vs 2018, but it was the way in which they used it and the result they gained from it which showed massive improvement from 2018.
Play-action was a different animal. Smith used much more play-action in 2019 than he did in 2018. In 2018, the Titans used play-action on 42% of early down dropbacks the first three quarters, the fifth-highest rate in the NFL. The benefits to such plays were negligible. YPA improved by 0.3 and the success rate, as well as EPA, didn’t improve at all.
However, in 2019 Smith increased their play-action rate to 52% on these plays, the highest rate in the NFL. And the results were noticeable, even with Mariota at the helm. Splits:
• With P/A: 10.7 YPA, 44% success, 0.24 EPA/att, 117 rating
• W/O P/A: 6.2 YPA, 34% success, -0.23 EPA/att, 77 rating
And with Tannehill, the results just rocketed off the charts:
• With P/A: 12.2 YPA, 65% success, 0.34 EPA/att, 139 rating
• W/O P/A: 7.0 YPA, 51% success, -0.04 EPA/att, 87 rating

Forget even intelligently increasing the rate of play-action usage from 2018 to 2019 for a moment.
Using pre-snap motion or play-action in 2018 for the Titans didn’t create a noticeable bump in efficiency, despite how the average team gets a boost from both.
The ability for Arthur Smith to get that much more out of pre-snap motion and play-action from 2018 to 2019 was absolutely incredible, regardless of whether it was Marcus Mariota or Ryan Tannehill at the helm.
While there is no doubt that trade for Tannehill was Jon Robinson’s biggest, most important acquisition, there is one that is swept under the radar but needs to be brought to light. A seemingly innocuous mid-season signing of a running back off the Vikings practice squad, Khari Blasingame.
On the surface, it didn’t seem like much. The team cut Rod Smith and had only two backs on the roster, so they added Blasingame, an undrafted rookie out of Vanderbilt. But that’s when things start getting interesting.
The signing occurred during the Titans’ bye week. Both Vrabel and Robinson scouted Blasingame at Vanderbilt’s Pro Day and invited him to the Titans’ practice facility for a visit. Blasingame wasn’t just a running back, however, he also doubled as a fullback. The Titans’ prior fullback, David Fluellen, was placed on IR after playing in only two games much earlier in the season.
The Titans hadn’t used a fullback on the field in weeks, but came out of the bye against the Jaguars and ran a whopping 17 plays with a fullback on the field. All told, after going 0% two-back sets for weeks, a full third of the Titans’ plays against the Jaguars featured a fullback. Tennessee saw tremendous success in 21 personnel. Runs recorded 9.7 YPC, 83% success, and 0.32 EPA/att. Passes recorded 14.5 YPA, 100% success, and 0.85 EPA/att.
Robinson, Vrabel, and Smith had found something.
After using 2-back sets on just 1% of plays the first 10 games of the season, the Titans closed the year using 2-back sets on 19% of plays the rest of the season. With the team thrashing four of their final six opponents to close the regular season, it’s more important to look at first half production. In the first half of games the rest of the season, the Titans’ most productive rushing grouping, by far, was 21 personnel:

21: 6.3 YPC, 68% success, 0.16 EPA/att 11: 5.4 YPC, 56% success, 0.04 EPA/att 12: 4.9 YPC, 49% success, 0.08 EPA/att
And if we look at the full games the rest of the season, the most productive passing grouping was 21 personnel:
21: 13.3 YPA, 91% success, 0.51 EPA/att 12: 13.3 YPA, 62% success, 0.43 EPA/att 11: 7.8 YPA, 52% success, 0.07 EPA/att 13: 10.9 YPA, 50% success, -0.35 EPA/att
Credit is due here to the general manager and head coach for bringing in a capable fullback, but a significant amount of credit is also due to Smith for seamlessly incorporating him mid-season and doing so to the tune of the most efficient rushing and receiving production the team delivered the rest of the season.
Ryan Tannehill’s production was incredible last season and the offense took off at that point. The numbers are undeniable, by almost any metric.
An even more convincing way to look at the data is through the lens of points scored per minute of possession. It’s raw, but intuitively factors in so many things including early down efficiency, third down efficiency, explosiveness, red zone performance, etc.
• With Mariota at the helm, the Titans averaged 0.43 points per minute.
• The NFL average last year was 0.57 points per minute.
• The best team in the NFL was the Chiefs at 0.77 points per minute.
• With Tannehill at the helm, the Titans averaged 0.99 points per minute.
We’re not talking a moderate improvement, we’re talking almost 30% better than the NFL’s best offense, the Chiefs. There are other ways to look at efficiency and the improvement that was enjoyed post-Mariota.

Through six weeks, the Titans passing game ranked 31st in the NFL in success rate (35%) and last in the league in missed yards per pass attempt (5.0). After switching over to Ryan Tannehill as the starting quarterback in Week 7, Tennessee then ranked fifth in the league in success rate passing (50%) and first in the league in yards above successful rate (71%). After throwing for 7.0 yards per pass attempt and a 4.2% touchdown rate prior to this season and left to restart his career as a backup to Marcus Mariota, Tannehill’s 9.6 yards per pass attempt ranked fourth all-time for a season in which a quarterback attempted at least 100 passes. His 7.7% touchdown rate trailed only Lamar Jackson (9.0%) among quarterbacks in 2019. It remains to be seen how much of a career outlier Tannehill’s 2019 spike in production was and how much of it he can sustain after inking a new four-year extension with the team this offseason.

Operating on the high-level efficiency that Tannehill was producing, Tennessee ranked fifth in the league in yards per attempt to their wide receivers (9.6 yards) and fifth in success rate (56%) targeting their wideouts. The team hit an absolute home run on second-round rookie A.J. Brown, who became just the 18th rookie wide receiver to reach 1,000 yards receiving since the 1970 merger. As part of his 52-1,051-8 line, Brown averaged 20.2 yards per catch while ranking second in the league in yards after the catch per reception (8,9 yards). The Titans also ranked fifth in yards per attempt to their tight ends (8.6 yards) and seventh to their running backs (6.6) despite being well below the league rate in target rate to their backs (14%).

The Titans ran the ball at the fourth-highest rate in the league (46.8%), ranking fourth in the league in EPA via rushing, eighth in success rate (51%), third in yards per carry (5.0), and first in yards above success rate (54%). Despite missing a game, running back Derrick Henry led the NFL in carries (303) and rushing yards (1,540) while he tied for the league lead with 16 rushing touchdowns. Including postseason games, Henry has now scored 28 touchdowns over his past 23 games played with 10 100-yard rushing yard performances. Brought back on the franchise tag this season, the Titans project to run their offense once again through Henry while they selected Darrynton Evans in the third round (93rd overall) of this year’s draft to replace Dion Lewis behind Henry.
It was borderline insane how Tennessee closed the 2019 season on an efficiency level paired with team approach — almost to the point where none of it made any sense. That in itself makes the Titans a fragile team investment from a top-down stance because we have to anticipate some offensive decline.
The team ranked first in yards generated above success rate in both rushing and passing once Ryan Tannehill took over as the starting quarterback. The team scored a touchdown on 34.5% of their offensive drives under Tannehill, which was second in the NFL and way above the 22.0% league rate. Even more wild in their scoring efficiency, the Titans scored a touchdown on 26 of 30 of their possessions (86.7%) over that span that ended inside of the red zone. They were held to just one field goal on those red zone possessions to go with three turnovers. The league rates over that span were at 59.1% of red zone possessions ending in a touchdown and 30.8% ending in a field goal try. For the season, the Titans scored a touchdown on 77.4% of their red zone opportunities, the highest rate in the league for a season in the 2000s.
Over the previous 10 seasons, there have been seven teams to score on 70% of their red zone possessions. In the following season, those teams averaged a 53.5% touchdown rate in the red zone. All of those teams scored fewer touchdowns the following season with an average loss of 12 touchdowns scored among those teams.
A.J. Brown was the 18th rookie wideout to hit 1,000 yards in his first season, but Brown was the first of those players to do so on fewer than 100 targets (84) and 60 receptions (52). Brown ranked second in the league in yards per route run (2.67) behind Michael Thomas. But he also had 5-64-0 line on 10 targets over three postseason games, which is a reminder that you are also betting on the identity of this offense creating a high floor for a player expected to make a significant jump in cost. Brown accounted for 27.3% of the team receiving touchdowns and 27.9% of the team receiving yardage on just 18.9% of the team receptions with Tannehill under center. Those are marks that are going to inherently flatten out, but with more inefficiency comes more volume. Even with regression, I believe Brown is a solid fantasy option moving forward since lead wide receivers with minimal competition are in short supply.
Ryan Tannehill will very much likely need to sustain passing efficiency above the base rate since the one thing we do know is that we know who the Titans are from a systematic approach, which is a run-first team. There have been 53 other quarterback seasons since the 1970 merger in which a passer hit a 7.0% touchdown rate on 100-plus attempts and then came back and hit that threshold for pass attempts the following season. Just one of those passers (Dave Krieg in 1987-1988) increased his previous season touchdown rate and just one other passer (Aaron Rodgers 2011-2012) hit that 7.0% mark again in the next season.
All of that points to still buying in on Derrick Henry since he has the most projectable volume. But Henry himself is a fantasy scorer that needs touchdowns. Well, they all do, but not to the degree Henry does since he is almost a zero in the passing department. Henry has yet to have more than 18 catches in any season, but has scored 28 touchdowns over his past 23 games played, which carry his totals. 32.6% of Henry’s 2019 PPR scoring output came via rushing touchdowns alone, the highest dependency among top-12 scorers at the position. The average rushing touchdown makeup of fantasy scoring from the same group of backs outside of Henry was 18.2%. We can buy that both Henry and Brown are the featured players at their positions on this roster, but the top-down team regression in overall scoring leaves a lot of unknown potential for a lower floor than assumed for any of the Tennessee offensive players.

Tennessee traded away Jurrell Casey and while part of that was about a big cap hit for the veteran, it was also a vote of confidence in the health and development of last year’s first-round pick Jeffery Simmons, who played in nine games and started seven in 2019. DaQuan Jones was good against the run, but without Casey, there’s little pass rush here pending Simmons’s improvement.
Harold Landry had a strong season on the edge, though he ranked just 48th of 112 edge rushers with at least 200 pass rushes in pressure rate per SIS. The Titans signed Vic Beasley to a one-year deal, but it’s hard to view that as a “prove-it” deal since we have a pretty good idea of what Beasley is, which is not an impact edge rusher. There continue to be rumors of Jadeveon Clowney interest, which would certainly help this group add an impact player, but those have been there since free agency started and there has been little development.
Jayon Brown followed up a great 2018 season with another standout season in 2019 as an off-ball linebacker. His 2018 breakout came mostly as a pass rusher with 10 quarterback hits. He took to coverage in 2019 with eight passes defensed. He now has 18 over the past three seasons. Rashaan Evans wasn’t much of a coverage backer but he was able to defend the run quite well in the middle of the defense. The Titans spent a lot of time in nickel and dime packages last season, which limited the amount they relied on a heavy rotation of linebackers.
By Adjusted Yards allowed per coverage snap, which factors in touchdowns and interceptions, both Adoree Jackson and Malcolm Butler were around average starting corners last season. Jackson has developed his speed into good coverage ability, though his passes defensed have dropped from 17 to 10 to six over the past three seasons. Tennessee added Jonathan Joseph in free agency and Kristian Fulton in the second round to add depth behind them.
Kevin Byard is one of the league’s best safeties and his high level of play continued in 2019. Kenny Vaccaro split his time between the box and free safety but did his best work closer to the line of scrimmage. If the Titans want to keep Vaccaro there often, Amani Hooker, a 2019 fourth-round pick, could be a good third safety.  In the first six weeks with Marcus Mariota, the Titans averaged a tragic 9.7 yards-to-go on third downs in the first half, second-worst in the NFL. They sat behind only the Jets and predictably converted at a low rate (ranked fifth-worst in conversion rate).
But from Week 7 onward, with Ryan Tannehill at the helm, the Titans averaged 6.5 yards-to-go on first half third downs, ninth-best in the NFL and a full 3.2 yards better than with Mariota. They recorded the 12th best conversion rate on these third downs.
Tannehill’s player tracking metrics were in such stark contrast to Mariota’s it’s shocking they were even on the same offense. Tannehill’s air yards to the sticks ranked third of 39 quarterbacks, while Mariota ranked 35th. Tannehill’s aggressiveness ranking ranked sixth vs Mariota’s 27th. Based on factors like receiver separation from the nearest defender, where the receiver is on the field and the separation the passer had at the time of throw from the nearest pass rusher, both Mariota and Tannehill should have completed roughly 62% of their attempts. The difference was Mariota completed only 59% and Tannehill completed 70%. Tannehill ranked first in CPOE (completion percentage over expectation) whereas Mariota ranked 29th.
So the big question is, can this offense replicate this magic to hopefully go even deeper in the postseason in 2020?
The good news is that from a rushing perspective, I think the answer is yes, barring injury. The Titans were the NFL’s third-healthiest team in 2019, and if that continues, it will be hard to derail the ground game given the diversity, their ability to run behind a fullback, and frankly, because I predict they will face the NFL’s easiest schedule of run defenses.
But the passing offense is a different story. I don’t know if Tannehill has it in him to exceed his expected completion rate by such a large margin again in 2020. He’s also facing more difficult passing defenses (the fifth-largest increase in schedule difficulty in the NFL). With Tannehill at the helm, the Titans faced seven top-half pass defenses and went 4-3. They went 5-1 against bottom-half pass defenses.
Tannehill was night and day with play-action. Without play-action, Tannehill was mortal (7.0 YPA, 51% success, -0.04 EPA/att, 87 rating), so how do defenses adjust this offseason and try to minimize the gains play-action gave Tannehill?
And then there’s this nugget: since the last uncapped season (2010), 11 teams spent at least 17.5% of total salary cap on just two players: QB1 & RB1 Results:
• 9 of 11 had losing records
• 6.8 wins on avg
• only two made playoffs: 0-1 each in their playoff game
The Titans are in this bucket after giving Tannehill a four-year, $118 million extension and putting the franchise tag on running back Derrick Henry ($10.3 million).
Prior to 2019, I forecast the Titans to face the fourth-toughest schedule. They ended up with the fourth easiest schedule, the biggest variance between predicted and actual. What happened? No Andrew Luck, no Cam Newton, and they didn’t play two games against Nick Foles or Deshaun Watson. Plus, bad seasons after higher pre-season expectations for the 2019 Browns and Falcons.
There are some positives, however. The first is Smith continuing as offensive coordinator and has the opportunity to further develop this offense with Tannehill. Second is the Titans went just 3-3 in one-score games, so there is no impending regression. The team made a ridiculous 47% of their field goals, and finished -33% in net field goal rate, both last in the NFL by far, with the latter being down 30% (from -3%) in 2018. This should regress to the benefit of the Titans.
Also, the Titans face my projected second-easiest schedule in 2020. The 2019 Titans were able to run the ball thanks to a positive game script against easy opponents and the second-easiest schedule of run defenses. In 2020, the Titans play the NFL’s easiest schedule of run defenses.
On the defensive side of the ball, the Titans play the NFL’s second-easiest schedule of opposing offenses. They face just three teams all season that ranked in the top-half of the NFL in offensive efficiency in 2019.
The Titans play a tough Week 1 road game in Denver on Monday night, but fortunately, follow up that short week of rest with a home game against the lowly Jaguars. They also host a Thursday night game and catch the Colts as Indy travels with a short week of preparation. The downsides of the schedule include late-season road games against the Ravens and Titans, but fortunately for the Titans, they have a mini-bye prior to facing Baltimore.
