<p>To suggest I was critical of the Detroit Lions offense in last year’s preview would be kind.
But let’s take things back a couple of years to understand how the Lions offense has b
evolved in recent years.</p>
<p>downfield when passing, specifically on first down. They did it in spurts, but were
extremely successful when doing so. They won nine games in 2017.</p>
<p>But they fired head coach Jim Caldwell and hired Matt Patricia to lead them into the 2018 .season. Patricia brought on players like LeGarrette Blount and effectively neutered any aggressiveness offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter had when he remained on staff as .a holdover from the prior regime.</p>
<p>And in 2018, all aggressiveness disappeared.</p>
<p>Prior to the 2017 season, I wrote in my preview that I wanted the Lions to look deeper</p>
<p>On first downs in the first half, Matthew Stafford threw deep on just 5.5% of his attempts.</p>
<p>Almost 95% of these first down attempts were within 15 yards of the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>The Lions ranked dead last in deep attempt rate.</p>
<p>For comparison, the NFL average was 19% deep attempts on first half first downs.
A whopping 70% of Stafford’s first down attempts in the first half were thrown within five yards of the line of scrimmage.
So following the 2018 season, and in previewing the 2019 season, last year I challenged the Lions and their new offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell. They needed to get more aggressive, shift from being as conservative a first down run-first team, and allow Stafford to pass deep more often on first down.
The message resonated. BIG TIME.
Stafford went deep on first half first downs on a massive 30.2% of his attempts, up from 5.5% in 2018. He passed within five yards of the line of scrimmage only 43% of attempts, down from 70% in 2018.
Only one team was more aggressive on these first down passes (Tampa Bay). The Lions went from 32nd to second in one offseason.
Tracking air yards (yards before the catch) vs YAC (yards after the catch), Stafford’s 2018 YAC accounted for 55% of his total yards, which ranked 44th. In 2019, only 37% of his total yards were YAC, improving to fourth-best in the NFL.
On third downs specifically, Stafford’s rate of passes thrown beyond the sticks improved from 23rd in 2018 to best in 2019.
Stafford also ranked first in average completed air yards at 8.3. For comparison, No. 5 was all the way back at 7.1, and the NFL average was 5.9. Aaron Rodgers was at 5.4.
His expected completion rate was only 60.9%, which ranked 38th of 39 QBs. Expected completion rate is calculated by factoring in receiver separation from the nearest defender, where the receiver is on the field, the separation the passer had at time of throw from the nearest pass rusher, and more. In other words, he should have had some of the worst production in the league based on where he threw the ball, but he had some of the best.
Stafford also ranked first in aggressiveness, as measured by attempts into tight coverage where there is a defender within a yard of the receiver at the time of completion or incompletion.
Behind this aggressive attack was a beautiful game script that fit Matthew Stafford like a glove.
In the first quarter of games last year, Stafford recorded 11.4 YPA (aDOT of 10.3 yards), a 67% success rate, a 134 rating, and threw six touchdowns against only one interception. Stafford ranked first in all of those efficiency metrics.
Stafford’s productivity in the pass game in the first quarter allowed the Lions to trail only twice entering the second quarter in his eight starts, and those were by margins of 1 point and 3 points (and he rallied to win both of those games).
To start the season, the Lions were 2-0-1, beating the Eagles and Chargers and drawing a tie against the Cardinals. The schedule was about to get worse, with the next three games for the undefeated Lions coming against the Chiefs, Packers, and Vikings.
But thanks to the brilliantly scripted and schemed first quarter, relying often on Stafford’s arm to push the ball downfield, the Lions led every single one of those games. Not by a little bit. By 10 points, 10 points, and 7 points, respectively.
Those were not insignificant first quarter leads and they came against three playoff teams, including the eventual Super Bowl champions.
Historically, teams with 7+ point leads after the first quarter win 77% of their games. The Lions even held leads entering the second quarter and were leading or tied at halftime in all three.</p>
<p>But Detroit lost all three of those games. A big reason for those three eventual losses came on third downs in the second halves.
In the first half of those games, they had a 50% conversion rate on third down. Part of that was that six of 20 third downs were short yardage (1-2 yards to go). But they also were solid on their conversions of medium (3-6 yards to go) and long (7-9 yards to go) third downs, where they converted 75% and 67%, respectively.
In the second half, an overall 50% conversion rate dropped to 25%. Instead of having short yardage situations on third down as they did on 30% of attempts in the first half, they had short yardage on just 1 of 16 (6%) second half third downs. Conversion rate on third and medium dropped from 75% to 20%, and third and long dropped from 67% to 17%.
Why did the Lions find themselves in more third and long situations and fewer third and short situations in the
second half?</p>
<p>Part of it had to do with their play selection on first down.
It wasn’t just in these three games, either. Weeks 1 through 9, despite Matthew Stafford leading the NFL with 9.5 YPA in the first half, the Lions came out of the locker room and ran the ball on 60% of their first down play calls. This was a rate well above what the Lions ran on first downs in the first half.
These runs gained a terrible 2.7 YPC and produced a 25% success rate.
It would be easier to pin more of the blame on the run game were it not for the passing game being terrible on first downs as well. Stafford passed for just 6.4 YPA, a 30% success rate, a 30.8 passer rating and 0:2 TD:INT on first downs in the third quarter.
Stafford went from the best quarterback in the NFL in the first quarter to the 23rd ranked quarterback in the third quarter, as well as the NFL’s worst quarterback on third quarter first downs.
The first down play calling in the third quarter torpedoed the Lions, both the run-heaviness and the inefficient passing. The Lions touchdowns by quarter in Matthew Stafford’s eight starts:
1st quarter: 9 2nd quarter: 6 3rd quarter: 2 &lt; 4th quarter: 7
The Lions must re-examine their first down playcalling in the third quarter. They trailed at halftime in just two of eight games, with those margins being just 3 and 4 points. Yet they won only three of eight games.
The run-heavy strategy out of the halftime locker room bled into the fourth quarter. The Lions went 57% run (60% in the third quarter) on these first downs and such runs gained just 2.5 YPC with a 38% success rate.
All told in Stafford’s starts, the Lions went approximately 50/50 run/pass on first half first downs to 59% run in the second half, with runs gaining just 2.6 YPC with a 31% success rate.</p>
<p>Compared to first half first down runs, which gained 4.5 YPC with a 48% success rate, the Lions simply were not doing themselves any favors — particularly when Stafford had been so brilliant in the first half passing the ball.
One specific item that caused problems for Stafford in the second half was passing into Cover 3 zone on early downs. Stafford seemed better prepared to deal with Cover 3 in the first half. He recorded an overall performance 8.7 YPA, 56% success, and 128.5 rating against it in the first half and was pressured on 32% of his dropbacks against Cover 3. But in the second half, he recorded an overall performance on all dropbacks of 5.5 YPA, 33% success, and 64.9 rating against it and was pressured on 48% of his dropbacks.
I really liked elements of what I saw from the Lions offensive scheme, particularly in the first quarter of their games last year, and I do believe Bevell can work with Stafford to clean up some of what we saw last year, particularly in the second half of games. The offensive unit is relatively intact from what we saw in 2019, which should provide good continuity.
That said, I have no idea why the Lions continue to waste draft capital on backs. There have been just 64 total backs drafted since 2018 and the Lions lead the NFL with five taken. Only 15 running backs have been drafted in the first two rounds and the Lions are the only team to draft two in the first two rounds. Of 59 running backs with at least 30 attempts on first and 10, Bo Scarbrough (58%) and Kerryon Johnson (54%) ranked in the top 11 in success rate. And in the first half of games, Johnson ranked third of 36 backs with a 57% success rate on 1st and 10.
Detroit has long relied on its offense to win games, but this offseason they went heavy on the defensive side of the ball in free agency, trades, and the draft, including the No. 3 overall draft pick cornerback Jeff Okudah and third-round pick Julian Okwara. In free agency, the Lions added Jamie Collins, Nick Williams, Duron Harmon, and Danny Shelton. Fortunately for the Lions defense, they face the ninth-easiest jump in passing offenses faced in 2020 as compared to 2019, and my early schedule analysis has them shifting from playing the eighth-toughest offenses in 2019 to 18th in 2020.
After playing the third-toughest schedule in 2019, the Lions shift to the eighth-easiest in 2020. That shift is the third-most favorable of any team in the NFL. But the problem for the Lions is the easy part of the schedule is tightly packed right in the middle, from Weeks 6 to 12, where they play the NFL’s easiest schedule by far, taking on five of seven opponents that are projected to finish below .500.
Detroit went 0-9 last year against top-15 pass defenses and the Lions will start off the 2020 season with three top-15 pass defenses from 2019 in their first four games. They close with an absolutely brutal schedule, too. From Weeks 13 to 17, the Lions play the fourth-toughest schedule in the league, against five teams projected to finish at-or-above .500.</p>
<p>The Lions 2019 passing game can be broken down in output with and without Matthew Stafford, who appeared in only eight games due to a season-ending back injury. With Stafford on the field, Detroit ranked 10th in the league in success rate (49%) and fourth in yards per passing play (7.6 yards). Over their final eight games, Detroit ranked 30th in success rate (38%) and 31st in yards per passing play (5.1) with the offense helmed by Jeff Driskel and David Blough. Stafford was averaging a career-high 8.6 yards per pass attempt with a career-high 6.5% touchdown rate prior to injury while he led the NFL with an 11.4-yard average depth of target. Despite missing eight games, Stafford still ranked 13th in the league in passing yards on throws 20 or more yards downfield (810) after he had just 713 passing yards on those throws in 2018. Entering 2020 still at age 32, Stafford will look to build off of what was potentially going to be a career season.</p>
<p>Attached to Matthew Stafford, the Detroit wide receivers were excellent. Through eight games, Detroit ranked third in the NFL in yards per pass attempt to their wide receivers (9.9 yards) with a 56% success rate (sixth in the league). Over the final eight games, the team was 21st in yards per attempt to wideouts (7.3 yards) with a 45% success rate (27th). Even with Stafford, the offense did struggle getting the ball to their tight ends (7.2 Y/A, which was 20th) and running backs (5.6 Y/A, 24th), but they were dead last in the league in yards per attempt to their tight ends (4.6 yards) and running backs (3.0 yards) after losing Stafford for the season.</p>
<p>Through a plethora of injuries, the Lions were able to post a respectable 49% success rate on the ground (14th), but were 27th in yards above successful play, which means they were just above league average in required success, but at the bottom of the league in yardage gained beyond. That left them 23rd in EPA on the ground, coming in at 22nd in yards per carry. Kerryon Johnson missed eight games, giving him 14 games absent over his first two seasons in the league. Forcing the Lions’ hands to pursue another back with high draft capital, the team selected D’Andre Swift at the top of the second round, who averaged over 6.0 yards per carry and 9.0 yards per reception in all three of his seasons at Georgia.</p>
<p>Investing in the Lions Passing Game
Matthew Stafford was quietly the QB4 in points per game (20.8) in eight starts last year. Through eight games, Stafford posted a career-high 8.6 yards per pass attempt and a career-high 6.5% touchdown rate. He then missed the rest of the season with a back injury. That injury likely prevented some inevitable regression as Stafford had the fifth-easiest passing schedule over his eight starts, but the change in offensive approach under Darrell Bevell was a breath of fresh air for Stafford’s aggressiveness paired with their receiving corps.
Stafford was let loose downfield after being an intermediate passer under the previous regime. Stafford led the NFL with an 11.4-yard average depth of target after marks of 7.1 yards (36th) 8.8 yards (20th) 7.9 yards (31st), and 6.9 yards (37th) the four previous seasons. Stafford attempted a pass 20 or more yards downfield on 19.2% of his throws, which was the highest rate in the league. League average was at 12.1% in 2019. We know what we are getting from Stafford as he has now been in the top-12 in points per game in eight of the past 10 seasons, while the offensive scheme and pass catchers are tailored around pushing the ball downfield.
With Stafford under center, Kenny Golladay was the WR11, averaging 17.4 PPR points per game while Marvin Jones was the WR14 in overall scoring, averaging 16.5 points per game. Golladay secured 35-of-62 targets (56.5%) for 640 yards (18.3 yards per catch and seven touchdowns over that span while Jones reeled in 42-of-57 targets (73.6%) for 535 yards (12.7 yards per catch and six touchdowns). Over the remainder of the season, Golladay held steady, catching 30-of-54 targets (55.6%) for 550 yards (18.3 Y/R) and four touchdowns, but Jones was unable to stay healthy or survive the quarterback shift, catching 20-of-35 targets (57.1%) for 244 yards and three touchdowns from David Blough and Jeff Driskel over his five remaining games played over the season.
Golladay led the NFL with 36 targets on throws 20 or more yards downfield while he was tied for second among all wide receivers with 14 end zone targets. His high average depth of target (16.1 yards) leaves a lot of potential for variance (just 61.9% of his targets were catchable, which ranked 77th out of 86 receivers and was 58.1% from Stafford) but those downfield and end zone are the types of targets that we want to pursue.
Jones has been a top-30 scorer in points per game in each of the past three seasons and is coming off a career-high 4.8 receptions per game. Jones was unlikely to maintain that gaudy 73.6% catch rate (he has secured 60% of his targets for his career) even with Stafford staying on the field, but Jones carries spike-week potential (three top-12 scoring weeks over those eight games), which is higher than some company he keeps in price point as a fringe WR3/WR4 option. The downside is that Jones has some volatility (four weeks outside of the top-50 with Stafford) and has missed 10 games over the past two seasons.</p>
<p>Detroit moved on from Damon Harrison, who had a down year in 2019 after being one of the best run-stuff tackles in football over the past few seasons. As a replacement, Danny Shelton was one part of the “what if we made the whole defense out of ex-Patriots” plan from this offseason. Shelton had a good year with the Patriots after his first seasons with the Cleveland Browns were nothing special. The Lions also brought in Nick Williams, who had a breakout season for the Bears as a rotational tackle with five starts. Williams had nine quarterback hits, six sacks, and two passes defensed last season.
Trey Flowers was Step 1 in “what if we made the whole defense out of ex-Patriots” last offseason. Flowers came in on a big deal after a high pressure-rate, low-sack season with New England. The problem was the pressure also fell off for Flowers in his first year in Detroit. Overall the Lions were 30th in pressure rate, per SIS, and 32nd in Pass Rush Win Rate last season. They could use a massive upgrade — or at least more depth — at the position. Julian Okwara was drafted in the third round and joins his brother Romeo Okwara on the edge opposite Flowers.
Hey, look, another former Patriot. Jamie Collins was a swiss army knife in his second stint with New England. He played off-ball, had plus coverage, and was one of the league’s best pass rushing linebackers (he led all linebackers with 100+ pass rush snaps in pressure rate per SIS). None of that translated to Cleveland when he left New England the first time bit with a former Patriots defensive coordinator running this defense, Collins should be used in a similar way.
There’s a lot of linebackers on the depth chart, but not a lot of plus production. Jahlani Tavai gave some flashes in his rookie season, but there’s still plenty of questions among this group.
The Lions traded away Darius Slay, which left a big hole on the outside. Detroit filled that with the selection of Jeff Okudah with the third overall pick. Okudah is one of the best overall cornerback prospects and should flourish in a man-heavy defense. Desmond Trufant, who struggled with the Falcons last season, is on the roster but is nowhere near a sure thing. Justin Coleman was the big free agent acquisition last season and his play fell off terribly in 2019 after a stellar season in the slot during 2018. There’s hope he can bounce back. Darryl Roberts and Tony McRae don’t add much as free agent acquisitions from this offseason, but there is some potential in Amani Oruwariye for his second season.
Duran Harmon finishes off the Patriots plan at safety. He played well at safety in the Patriots dime-heavy looks and lined up in a few places across the secondary. Tracy Walker also covered quite well last season and saved the backend of the Lions’ secondary after the Quandre Diggs trade. Jayron Kearse was a good third safety with the Vikings and could get on the field more often with the Lions.</p>
