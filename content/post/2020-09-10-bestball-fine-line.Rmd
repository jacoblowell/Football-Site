Bestball is a niche form of fantasy football where a group of 12 players takes turns drafting teams of 18-20 players who will then score points in the following NFL season.  A common breakdown of a 20 man roster would consist of 3 quarterbacks, 6 running backs, 8 wide recievers and 3 tight ends.  Each week, a team will compile a score from the roster so that it maximizes the sum of the 8 highest scoring players, with the positional contraints of 1 quarterback, 2-3 running backs, 3-4 wide recievers and 1-2 tight ends.  

I have enjoyed playing these contest at [MFL/Fanball](https://bestball10s.shgn.com/) for the past few years, and they have also been popular at [Draft](https://draft.com/), who was acquired by a [Fanduel](https://www.fanduel.com/) entity at the end of [2019](https://gridironexperts.com/draft-shutsdown-merges-with-fanduel).
